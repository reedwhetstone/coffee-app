  "message": "# Roast analysis and dial-in plan\n\nI dug into your last 15 roasts and pulled out the key patterns. Overall you’re in a light-roast zone (13.7–14.0% weight loss on the batches with data), with tasty fruit expression on the naturals. The biggest opportunities are more consistent first crack timing, better-controlled development time, and tidier data capture to make changes repeatable.\n\n## What I’m seeing\n- **Development is inconsistent and sometimes too short:**\n  - Costa Rica Anaerobic (roast 276): FC at 12:09, drop at 12:49 → **~40s dev, 5.8%** dev% (very short). Weight loss 13.9%.\n  - Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Natural (roast 277): FC at 10:20, drop at 11:19 → **~59s dev, 9.5%** dev% (closer). Weight loss 13.7%.\n  - Ethiopia Guji (roast 273): Total 7:03 with FC at 6:23 → **~40s dev, 14.8%** dev% but overall roast is extremely fast for a ~15 oz batch.\n- **FC timing swings a lot** (from 6:23 to 12:09), which will cause big flavor and texture shifts.\n- **Weight loss is nicely clustered** (13.7–14.0% where recorded) suggesting light roasts, but sensory on the Colombia reports \"wet earth,\" which can indicate underdevelopment, quakers, or smoky contamination.\n- **Data quality issues:** several imports from Artisan show unit mix-ups (e.g., oz_out 256.2 likely grams), and many sessions are missing key events (FC temp/time, drop temp). This makes fine-tuning harder than it needs to be.\n\n## Bean-by-bean recommendations\n\n### 1) Costa Rica Solis & Cordero Anaerobic Natural (roast 276)\n- Goal: tame fermenty volatility, add sweetness and body without losing fruit.\n- Targets:\n  - FC: 9:30–10:30 (for a ~400–450 g batch)\n  - Development: **70–90s (9–12%)**\
