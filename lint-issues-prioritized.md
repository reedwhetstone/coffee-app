# Lint Issues Prioritized by Criticality

**Total Issues: 385 errors**

## CRITICAL - Runtime Failures (Fix Immediately)

### 1. TypeScript Global Type Issues

- `src/lib/components/VirtualScrollList.svelte:9,11,15,32,75` - 'T' is not defined (5 issues)

**Total Critical: 5 issues**

## HIGH - Type Safety Violations (Fix Soon)

### Explicit `any` Types (~380 issues across multiple files)

Major files with high `any` usage:

- `src/routes/roast/RoastLogChart.svelte` - ~151 issues
- `src/routes/roast/+page.svelte` - ~49 issues
- `src/routes/beans/+page.svelte` - ~34 issues
- `src/routes/beans/BeanDetailsDialog.svelte` - ~19 issues
- `src/lib/services/ragService.ts` - ~13 issues
- `src/routes/roast/RoastChartInterface.svelte` - ~12 issues
- `src/routes/roast/RoastHistoryTable.svelte` - ~9 issues
- `src/routes/roast/RoastProfileForm.svelte` - ~6 issues
- Plus 40+ other files with 1-8 issues each

**Total High: ~380 issues**

## MEDIUM - Code Quality Issues (Address When Convenient)

### ✅ COMPLETED - All unused imports and variables have been removed!

- Fixed skeleton component placeholder variables with ESLint disable comments
- Removed unused imports from ChatMessageRenderer, RoastProfileDisplay, RoastProfileForm
- Removed unused variables from hooks.server.ts and scripts files
- Cleaned up layout component unused props and variables

**Total Medium: 0 issues** ✅

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (5 fixes)

1. Fix TypeScript generic type definitions in `VirtualScrollList.svelte`
   - Define proper generic type parameter `T`
   - Fix all type references that use undefined `T`

### Phase 2: High Priority - Type Safety (~380 fixes)

1. Start with most critical files (`RoastLogChart.svelte`, `+page.svelte` files)
2. Create proper TypeScript interfaces for frequently used objects
3. Gradually replace `any` with specific types
4. Focus on data structures passed between components

### Estimated Time Investment

- **Critical**: 30 minutes
- **High Priority**: 15-20 hours (spread across multiple sessions)

### Tools/Strategies

- Use TypeScript's `--strict` mode progressively
- Create shared type definitions for common data structures
- Use IDE refactoring tools for bulk type inference where possible

### Progress Since Last Analysis

- **Reduced total issues from 420 to 385** (-35 issues, 8.3% improvement)
- **Critical issues remain at 5** (unchanged)
- **High priority issues remain ~380** (primarily `any` types)
- **Medium priority issues reduced from 42 to 0** (-42 issues, 100% complete!) ✅

## ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED

All unused imports and variables have been successfully removed! This represents a complete cleanup of:

- **36 unused variables** across skeleton and layout components
- **6 unused imports** in various service files  
- **Proper ESLint disable comments** for intentional placeholder variables

The codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable. Remaining work focuses primarily on replacing `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces for better type safety.
