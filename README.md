# Notes

"Democratizing coffee"

- coffee trends & green supply analysis
- micro-lots crowd funding
- green coffee marketplace
- Manage coffee inventory
- Track coffee roasting
- Track coffee sales
- Track coffee consumption

# Todo List

- [ ] BUG: cannot delete a bean from green coffee inventory if it is referencing a row from sales. May also be an issue from roast as well. Need a cascade function.
- [ ] Clean up roast page UI to align with beans page UI
- [ ] Clean up beans catalog profiles and remove user
- [ ] Summarize/rewrite front-end descriptions for fair use
- [ ] Form bean selection should be limited to stocked items - beans, roast, sales forms should all cater to active items.
- [ ] Add stocked column to green_coffee_inv and manage it in profiles
- [ ] Optimize duplication of data between green_coffee_inv and coffee_catalog - only need diplication on original, unreferenced coffees (not in catalog)
- [ ] Correct rank formatting to be two decimal places. Restructure UI to look better
- [ ] Fix database structure or front-end interpretation of text to retain paragraph formatting
- [ ] Analysis & Reporting - Create trends and analysis charting page. analysis first - priority is to make roasting fun and informational - not to run a business.
- [ ] remove fan and heat Y axis labels - leave the outside to temp labels
- [ ] get import data on fan and heat settings from artisan import file
- [ ] clean up temp curve so it doesn't look jagged
- [ ] clean up roast, bean, and profit UI to be more aligned with landing page and catalog page. Make it more interactive and less table format - profile & analytics first. 
- [ ] **TP, FC, dev % data calculations & population in roast chart interface!!**

## Web Scraping & Data Import


- **Bean Import Feature**
  - Add option to add a bean based on a URL
  - Implement automatic scraping for supported URLs

## UI/UX Improvements

### General

Modified RAG -
Instead of straight vector searching, use the filter tool in a more prominent way on the main search platform, then dial in the reccomendation based on the filtered results. Pass through the result the user filters into the seach LLM bot.

'Supplier & Origin Comparison Tools',
'Real-time Coffee Market Pricing Analysis',
'Price Trend Monitoring for Green Coffee',

- roast insights view that shows the roasts organized by bean so you can compare how each actual roast went with the beans instead of by batch.
- need a purchased qty remaining data set in beans category to add to the stocked functionality
- add % loss to the roast area displayed per roast.
- comprehensive ratings form - roast batch, brew method, nose, flavor, etc - will need a new table to manage this data.
- add lot buys for large orders like 22lb crown jewels
- Add loading states
- Fix real experience score and content paint
- Set up no-cookies banner at the bottom of the page
- Fix scroll issues (not rendering complete list of products)
