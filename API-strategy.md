# API Strategy: Building a Robust Coffee Intelligence Platform

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic approach for developing Purveyors into a true API-first platform that serves both internal application needs and external customers. The strategy focuses on leveraging our unique coffee data assets, AI capabilities, and professional expertise to create high-value API services.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing API Infrastructure
- **Robust authentication system** with bcrypt-hashed keys and tier-based access
- **Rate limiting** (200/month viewer, 10k/month api-member, unlimited enterprise)  
- **Usage logging and analytics** with comprehensive monitoring
- **Separate external API endpoint** (`/api/catalog-api/`) vs internal (`/api/catalog/`)
- **Row limiting by tier** (25 rows viewer, unlimited for paid tiers)

### Current Internal Data Flow
- Page server load functions fetch data directly from Supabase
- Some functionality uses internal API endpoints (stripe, profit tracking)
- Manual data joins and complex queries in server load functions
- Direct database access for most features

## Strategic Vision: API-First Architecture

### Core Architecture Concept

Create a **unified API layer** where:
1. **All internal app functionality** uses the same APIs sold externally
2. **API endpoints** become the single source of truth for all data operations
3. **Server load functions** become thin API consumers
4. **External and internal** requests use identical infrastructure with different authentication

### Architectural Components

#### 1. API Service Layer (`src/lib/api/`)
- Centralized business logic services
- Database operations abstraction
- Data transformation and validation
- Caching strategies

#### 2. Unified API Endpoints (`src/routes/api/v1/`)
- Versioned API structure
- Consistent response formats
- Error handling patterns
- OpenAPI documentation generation

#### 3. API Client Layer (`src/lib/clients/`)
- Internal API client for server-side usage
- Type-safe client with auto-generated types
- Request/response caching
- Error boundary handling

#### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- Enhanced middleware for internal vs external requests
- Unified permission system
- API key management for internal services

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach A: API-First Migration (Comprehensive)

**Timeline:** 10 weeks

**Phase 1: Core API Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)**
1. Create API service layer structure
2. Establish API standards (response formats, error handling, pagination)
3. Set up internal API client infrastructure

**Phase 2: Core APIs (Weeks 3-5)**
4. Enhance coffee catalog API with search, filtering, field selection, pagination
5. Create inventory management API (CRUD operations for user coffee inventory)
6. Build roast profiles API (roast data, chart endpoints, profile management)

**Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 6-7)**
7. Develop internal API client with authentication bypass and type safety
8. Migrate server load functions to use internal API client
9. Implement proper error boundaries and fallback mechanisms

**Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 8-10)**
10. Add analytics/profit tracking API endpoints
11. Create AI/ML API endpoints (semantic search, recommendations)
12. Generate comprehensive API documentation and developer tools

**Benefits:**
- Perfect API-product alignment
- Faster feature development
- Better testing and reliability
- Unified monitoring and debugging

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Performance overhead → Smart caching and connection pooling
- Migration complexity → Gradual migration with feature flags
- Breaking changes → Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### Approach B: Parallel API Development (Recommended)

**Timeline:** 12 weeks (overlapping with app development)

Build robust external APIs while maintaining flexibility to migrate internal app usage later.

## Technical Architecture Details

### API Response Format Standardization

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  meta: {
    total?: number;
    page?: number;
    limit?: number;
    cached?: boolean;
    api_version: string;
  };
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
  };
}
```

### Internal API Client Pattern

```typescript
// Internal server-side usage
const inventoryClient = new InternalApiClient();
const inventory = await inventoryClient.getInventory(userId, {
  filters: { stocked: true },
  fields: ['name', 'region', 'cost_lb'],
  limit: 50
});

// External API usage (same interface)
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/inventory', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer pk_live_...' }
});
```

### Service Layer Architecture

```typescript
// Business logic services
class InventoryService {
  async getInventory(userId: string, options: GetInventoryOptions) {
    // Unified business logic used by both internal and external APIs
  }
  
  async addToInventory(userId: string, coffee: AddCoffeeRequest) {
    // Single implementation, multiple API access patterns
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Advantages
- **Better Caching**: Centralized API caching benefits both internal and external users
- **Code Reuse**: Single implementation for all data operations
- **Scalability**: API layer can be optimized/scaled independently

- **Testing**: Easier to test API endpoints vs server load functions

### Potential Challenges
- **Additional Latency**: Internal requests now go through HTTP API layer
- **Complexity**: More abstraction layers to manage
- **Network Overhead**: JSON serialization for internal requests

### Performance Mitigations
- **Smart Caching**: Implement Redis/in-memory caching at API layer
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections
- **Response Streaming**: For large datasets
- **CDN Integration**: Cache static/semi-static responses
- **Internal Bypass**: Direct service calls for performance-critical operations
