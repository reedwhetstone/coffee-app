Process is a **sealed, 7–10 day anaerobic fermentation in carbon-fiber drums**, then raised-bed drying—adds layered fruit without boozy, over-fermented notes.\n- **Highlights:** 74110/74112 cultivars • Gedeo Zone • Score ~88 • $8.99/lb\n\n### Roast guidance (to spotlight stone fruit)\n- Aim for **light–medium (City+)**: end ~20–25% development past first crack; drop while the crack has tapered but **before second crack**. This keeps apricot/nectarine vibrant with creamy sweetness.\n- Airflow: medium–high to vent volatiles; keep drum energy steady to avoid baked notes.\n\n### Brew tips\n- **Pour-over (V60/Origami):** 1:16, 92–94°C, medium-fine. 40–45s bloom, 2–3 pours. If cup feels dense, add a **20–40 g bypass** to lift stone fruit.\n- **Espresso:** 1:2.2 in 28–32 s at ~93°C with 5–8 s preinfusion. Expect jammy strawberry/apricot with creamy body.\n\nI searched for other Ethiopia lots with unique processing (carbonic maceration, lactic, yeast-inoculated, honey/double-anaerobic) and didn’t see any currently in stock with stone-fruit callouts. Want me to set up alerts for those styles?\n",

					"description_long": "The first awesome Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Natural of the season! A bit on the exotic side but if you love traditional Ethiopian Naturals, don’t shy away from this one. Many times “Anerobic” processing gives the coffee a pretty intense sour/grape/winey tone, but in this case, it is a very mild processing. Not overly fermented, boozy, or sour. A lovely and very clean more fruit forward cup. The cup profiles here remind me of a very nice Yemen coffee, gets a bit of that “banana” fruity tone not often seen. Do not worry, its not like candied Banana, but between the more creamy cup character and a bit of tropical and traditional fruit notes, a couple folks pointed it out.\n\nDuring the harvest season in Ethiopia’s famed Yirgacheffe (Gedeo Zone), thousands of smallholder farmers hand‑pick ripe heirloom cherries from shaded garden plots intercropped with food crops—traditional low‑input agroforestry that preserves biodiversity and soil health. This Grade 1 “Supernatural” showcases the classic high‑elevation Yirgacheffe clarity plus intensified fruit sweetness—reflected in the official flavor callouts of strawberry jam, apricot, hibiscus, baking spice, and heavy cream.\n\nEnvironmental stewardship here is rooted in the farmers’ shade‑grown, organic‑style methods: diverse canopy cover, minimal synthetic inputs, intercropping, and raised‑bed sun drying—all practices that support pollinators, natural pest balance, and gradual, even drying that protects cup quality.\n\nA short regional history: Yirgacheffe’s smallholder cooperative and union structure helped formalize quality separation and direct export pathways—cooperative models across southern Ethiopia funnel premiums back into community infrastructure (schools, clinics, water, roads) and reinforce sustainable practices (shade retention, organic methods) to adapt to climate variability.\n\nThe Processing:\nThe supernatural processed coffees at the Banko Chelchele station are sorted by hand on arrival, then floated to remove less dense and damaged cherries. In the case of this microlot, fresh cherry is sealed into carbon fiber drums and left to ferment anaerobically (deprived of fresh oxygen) between 7 to 10 full days between 15-18 degrees Celsius. This stage allows the sugars in the fruit to develop far beyond where they would in a traditional natural without the risk of over fermenting.\n\nAfter the 10-day drum fermentation, the soft and syrupy cherry mixture is carefully moved to raised screen beds to dry, slowly and gradually.  Once it reaches a fully dried state, the pods are moved to a cool warehouse where they are left to rest for a number of weeks.  This last step allows the internal moisture to equilibrate and the water activity to settle, preparing the green coffee for a long shelf life of vibrant flavors.  Finally, the green coffee is trucked to Addis Ababa for additional sorting and preparation for export.",

Here are the best in-stock options now, starting with the most overt blueberry character:\n\n1) **Ethiopia Dry Process Hambela Buliye (Guji)** — Natural, raised-bed sun dried, ~2150–2200 MASL\n- **Why it fits:** Explicit callout of a dried blueberry note alongside sticky dried fruit and caramelized sugars. Consistently one of the fruitiest Guji naturals each year.\n- Score: 92 • Price: $9.10/lb • Sweet Maria’s\n\n2) **Ethiopian Guji Natural – Kayon Mountain (Shakiso)** — Natural, raised beds, 74110/74112\n- **Why it fits:** A classic Guji natural that often shows blueberry/berry with floral lift at lighter roasts. Versatile from light to medium.\n- Score: 89 • Price: $10.49/lb • Burman\n\n3) **Layo Teraga, Site 2, Natural, G2, FTO (Uraga, Guji)** — Natural, coop, 2342 MASL\n- **Why it fits:** Berry spectrum (blackberry/raspberry) with bright citrus—leans slightly darker-berry vs. blueberry, but still in the lane for fruity natural Ethiopia.\n- Score: 86.25 • Price: $9.91/lb • Showroom Coffee\n\nOptional (Decaf): **Ethiopia Sidama Shakiso Natural Decaf** — Natural, Mountain Water Process\n- **Why it fits:** “Berries, plum, brown sugar” profile that reads fruity for decaf; great if you want a blueberry-adjacent cup without caffeine.\n- Score: 85 • Price: $8.79/lb • The Captain’s Coffee\n\n---\n\n### Roast pointers to maximize blueberry\n- Target **City to City+**: drop roughly **45–90 seconds after first crack** (about **12–18% development**), before second crack. This preserves volatile berry esters and keeps cocoa from overtaking fruit.\n- **Heat/airflow:** Maintain a steadily declining RoR with no crash/flick; use **moderate airflow** to prevent smoky notes without scrubbing aromatics. Keep momentum into first crack, then gently taper.\n- For naturals like these, avoid extended Maillard—too much development mutes the blueberry into darker fruit/chocolate.\n\n### Brew tips for fruit-forward cups\n- **Pour-over (V60/155 flat-bottom/Origami):** 1:16, 92–93°C, medium to medium‑coarse. Gentle, center-weighted pours; total 2:45–3:15. If acidity feels sharp, add a 20–30 g bypass.\n- **Immersion/Hybrid (Clever/Hario Switch):** 18 g in, 300 g water at 93–94°C, 3:00 steep then draw down. Immersion tends to intensify jammy blueberry.\n- **Espresso (for fruity shots):** 1:2–1:2.2 in 28–32 s at ~93°C, light-to-medium roast. 5–8 s preinfusion helps even extraction. Expect blueberry jam over cocoa.\n\nWant me to set alerts for other blueberry “bombs” (e.g., Aricha, Bensa, Uraga microlots) as they hit stock?",

It’s even more rare to find an importer who will commit such an in-demand coffee as natural process Ethiopian coffee to decaf, but our trading partner Keffa Coffee has come through for decaf lovers.\n\nThis lot was hand selected from the harvest of many local smallholder farmers to showcase the local Sidama heirloom profile in classic natural processing. After fully drying and sorting, it traveled to Descamex, one of only two water decaf processing facilities in the world.

					"description_long": "Fresh Kayon Mountain has become a tradition around here, marks one of our favorite times of the year, new Ethiopian season!\n\nFirst top grade natural to sneak through for the new 2024/25 season! The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is 500 hectares with about 300 hectares planted in coffee and has been owned and operated by Ismael Hassen Aredo and his family since 2012. It is located 510 kilometers south of Addis Ababa, and the property crosses the border of two villages—Taro and Sewana—located in the Oromia region, in the Guji zone of the Shakiso district of Ethiopia.\n\nIsmael oversees a staff of 25 permanent full-time and 300 seasonal employees, and the farm management offers free transportation services as well as financial support for building schools and administration buildings for the community. The farm competes with a nearby mining village for seasonal workers, so Ismael and his family tend to pay higher wages to their pickers in order to incentivize them returning year after year. I had the pleasure of meeting Ismael personally this season on my Ethiopian trip Feb 2025. A wonderful operation and super tasty coffee. We have a few more Kayon Mountain lots incoming that we are sure you will love as well.\n\nThere are few entrances to Guji–a distant and heavily forested swath of land stretching southeast through the lower corner of the massive Oromia region–and none of these routes are short, or for the queasy, in any way. Guji is heavy with primary forest thanks to the Guji tribe, a part of Ethiopia’s vast and diverse Oromo nation, who have for generations organized and legislated to reduce mining and logging outfits in their area, in a struggle to conserve the land’s sacred canopy.\n\nCompared to other coffee-heavy regions, large parts of Guji feel like prehistoric backwoods. Coffee farms in many parts of Guji begin at 2000 meters in elevation and tend to climb from there. The highland farming communities in this part of the country can be at turns Edenic in their natural purity, and startlingly remote.\n\nNear the town of Taro, in the Odo Shakiso district, is Kayon Mountain, founded by Ismael Hassen, a native of Kercha district who was born and raised surrounded by Guji’s coffee culture. Kayon Mountain is a massive coffee estate with 500 planted hectares (well over 1000 acres) of select Ethiopian arabica cultivars. The coffee genetics were originally isolated and bred by the Jimma Agricultural Research Center, whose coffee agenda includes studying and distributing select indigenous cultivars of Ethiopian coffee to help domestic farms renew and remain disease-resistant as they evolve. 74110 and 74112 are some of the Center’s oldest, and are both descendants of heirloom varieties of coffee isolated from the Illubabor Zone, an historic coffee region in the West of Ethiopia—also a part of the Oromia Region.\n\nKayon Mountain is a standout, in many ways, among the broader landscape of Ethiopian coffee. To begin with, estates this large are rare in a country defined by its smallholder systems: there are over four million coffee farmers in Ethiopia and the average cultivation is a few hundred trees each. Next, Kayon Mountain exports its own coffee—a rare standing for farms of any size in Ethiopia—and as a result can bypass the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange auction entirely. Third, the estate was founded in 2012, when the Guji Zone government began carefully approving land grants to groups with ambitious organic farming plans that included the preservation of primary forest among their areas. So not only is the estate extremely young by Ethiopian standards, there is an environmental mandate built into their grant.\n\nThe Kayon Mountain team has increased production over the past seven harvests and is currently applying for an additional land grand to further expand their operation. In addition to their own planted land, the farm buys and processes cherry from 12 other local, larger farms which are also organic and Rainforest Alliance certified.\n\nThroughout the harvest the estate is picking from 9am-5pm. Naturals are produced simply and carefully, by sorting for imperfections and slowly drying on raised beds in the sun. Drying cherry is constantly rotated and sorted by hand at the tables by a large staff. After dry-hulling the finished coffee, which Kayon Mountain also oversees, a final hand-sorting occurs prior to bagging. Naturals produced here tend to be delicately floral and sweet with dried rose, raspberry, strawberry, and milk chocolate.\n\nEthiopia’s Guji zone in many ways feels like the next generation of Ethiopian coffee. We see the marketplace itself evolving constantly in this country–the very exciting new wave of direct exports for one, the rise of private washing stations and boutique domestic buyers for another, and the foundation of modernized, large estates with quality and social justice equally at the forefront, setting management examples for producers worldwide. Guji itself however, as a place, a people, and a coffee, is like a newly emerged origin altogether. The forest-heavy zone with a conservationist spirit and uniquely candy-like coffees is getting its break now, and the world is better for it.",

What's interesting about having a site that only produces naturals, is that you're not tied to a water source for processing coffee, and can build them very high in the mountain. Buliye rests in a very high altitude zone of around 2150-2200 meters above sea level, and the farms are planted at a wider range. On our last visit in 2024, we noticed there wasn't a lot of direct sunlight on the beds, which led to longer drying times of around 3-4 weeks. This year's coffee is as fruited as ever, and displays very nice level of acidity too, not always the case with natural processed coffee.",

					"description_long": "Dark sugar and fruit notes are bountiful in the dry fragrance, potent dried stone fruit allusions are right up front, with dark panela sugar, and vanilla caramel notes. The wet crust is aromatic, with amazing sweetness. Dried fruit and berry notes lead to wisps of fruit compote, with dark honey and an aromatic molasses hint in the steam. The cup has a complex range of sticky dried fruit flavors that are delicious, with thick, syrupy sweetness, and hints of berry that pop up as it cools. Dried apricot and mango notes were at the front of my mind when drinking this coffee, with a tartly sweet aspect that gives a nice impression of acidity. This coffee has a lot to offer as it cools, unfolding to accent notes of caramelized sugars, plum, and a dried blueberry note. Winey fruit hints accent the cup, with that bit of brightness that helps structure some of the wilder flavors. Deeper roasting develops a more berry-toned coffee, with hefty cocoa flavor that led right into notes of dried dark fruits, and still wielded some perceived acidity. A note on espresso: If you're a fan of fruity espresso, Buliye is incredible again this year! Syrupy-textured and fruit-forward, with lingering dark cocoa flavors that culminate in dark chocolate-covered fruit. That said, I'm withholding the espresso recommendation from the coffee \"Specs\" tab and short description because I think it is too wild for the average espresso drinker.",
