We were introduced to the coffee of Kahayya on a Sulawesi trip two years ago, and having tasted some really promising samples, were able to get out and see the area first-hand. The group farmers in Kahayya are loosely banded around a man named Marsan, who we had the pleasure of joining for a lovely tour of the village by foot, scooter, and truck! While coffee is pretty prevalent in this area, farmers are also growing other crops like cacao, clove, and pepper vines. You see a lot of very old coffee trees, including Line-s, and Typica types, some that Marsan claimed are over 100 years old. It would make sense considering the long history of coffee in this area that stretches back to Dutch colonizers. You also see a lot of very old Robusta in the area too, which is processed separately from the Arabica. The altitude in Kahayya ranges from 1400 to 1700 meters above sea level.",Farm Gate,"The ground coffee had an interesting scent of herbal honey accented by tobacco leaf, an earth toned aroma, and bittersweetness underneath. Low toned aspects that showed in the wet aroma were much more potent, with sharp cocoa notes, and a mossy accent. This lot cups a bit like wet hulled coffee in our assessment. That is to say that it has cup flavors we often taste in wet hulled coffee; tobacco, foresty peat, and fresh green aromatics. The sweetness had a very interesting herbal overlay that reminded me of horehound candy, or Ricola cough drops, and brought a resinous quality to the cup. Rounded mouthfeel fades to bittering cocoa powder in the finish.

She, and her husband Roger Chilcon, manage 3 hectares of land in El Diamante, on which they've planted a mix of Bourbon, and Caturra. Though not the only farmer to do this, Luz bags up the coffee cherry from the day's harvest and seals them up for about 24 hours before processing. The idea is to start fermentation within the cherry in the hopes of translating to a more complex cup (often realized as an increase in fruited notes). She and her husband also employ a somewhat long fermentation times (36 hours) which can have a similar affect on flavor profile. Once dry, the coffee is stored in polyethylene sacks that remain covered until transport in order to help preserve the quality. The coffee is still in it's outer parchment layer too, which also helps with freshness, and won't be peeled until ready for export.

The aroma smelled so sweet, and with interesting top note accents like brown sugar, black tea, apple, and honey granola. The cup showed subtle fruited accents that struck me as tasting like apricots, with a hint of orange that lights up the pallet. We noted the fruits are a bit jammy at first, fading to fruit tea notes as the coffee cools off some. Honey-like sweetness was a big part of the flavor profile too, which played well off some mild bittering tannic notes, and the finish had hints of cinnamon stick and lemon.

We've purchased their dry process coffee the past few years and were pleasantly surprised to learn they processed a small test batch of honey process last harvest, which only came to 2 bags (264 pounds!). Senna Farm is located in the Boter forest preserve, Limu Kossa, Jimma. It's actually the only coffee farm in this remote forest area, and the small clearing made for their processing site is pretty easy to spot on an areal map amidst the surrounding sea of green! This isn't a clear cut coffee farm, but rather, part of a government land grant where plots in agro forest areas were given away to farmers who could be good stewards to the land by maintaining the natural forest habitat. Senna Katta Mountain is owned by wife and husband Yodit, and Solomon. They are both pharmacists who met when opening a clinic in Limu Kossa sometime ago. Yodit's father was an agronomist in Jimma, working for the government, and it was their dream to build a farm in the area. With his help as their advisor, they did just that, stepping in as owners after the original owner was unable to keep up with the land improvements that were required. Senna Katta Mountain is 130 hectares in size, though only 110 hectares are under production. It's considered semi-forest coffee since it's not wild coffee, but still grows beneath the preserved forest canopy overhead. This is a very high elevation zone, the mill at 2300 meters with coffee growing even a little higher. Because of this, the coffee comes a bit later than most other areas we buy from.",Farm Gate,"Grinding the coffee let off a spiced sweetness of cinnamon bread with honey, accented by hints of rustic sugars, and a very nice note of dried peach. Stone fruits came through in the wet aroma too (as well as the cup!), along with a sweet scent of creamy caramels, cooked brown sugars, and a limey citrus note when breaking the crust. My City+ roast was very sweet honey flavors, and an herbal tenadam note that added to the cup aroma and lingered in the aftertaste. Top notes included natural dried apricot and peach, red cherry, and a pleasant bittering aspect in the finish that reminded me of peach skins. There was a bright citrus note in our light roast (Yuzu?) that played off sweetness, and gave the cup a structured feel. We also have a dry process lot from Senna Farm, which is the more fruit-forward counterpart to this honey.

  Description:    In 1977, Mr. Samuel Coto Escobar purchased Finca El Platanillo and managed it until 1985. In 1985 the farm management was passed to Mr. Samuel’s youngest son, Mr. Stuardo Coto. Since then, management has focused on the ecosystem, the community, coffee quality, and productivity.  
  Finca El Platanillo, Stuardo has managed to create an environment compliant with certifications and with his own personal quest to find the balance between the ecosystem and a productive coffee plantation as a wholesome unit. Close monitoring of flora and fauna has led to a rich environment where the ecosystem and the plantation planning go hand in hand. Protecting the ecosystem is a principle that have guided all the constant improvement that the farm undertakes each year. Because this principle was always priority, by the time certification programs such as RFA (Rainforest Alliance), Starbucks’ “Café Practices”, 4C, etc. came into existence; Finca El Platanillo was already in compliance with most of the requirements to obtain these certifications. Keeping Rainforest Alliance since 2005 to this day, and pioneering RFA’s Climate Module as the first farm in the world to implement this once extra sustainable program.  
  The community in the farm has access to their own garden to grow

This natural-processed coffee offered by Endebess Estate is fully washed with fresh river water from the Koitobos River and then sun-dried on raised beds. It typically takes 21 to 28 days to dry, depending on the weather. The beans are rotated at least four times a day.
Rift Valley contains the Cherang’any Hills and a chain of volcanoes, some of which are still active. The Cherang’any Hills are one of Kenya’s five main forests and catchment areas and span three counties, namely Trans Nzoia, Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot. The Endebess Estate farm is set at the foot of Mount Elgon, an extinct shield volcano on the border of Uganda and Kenya.
As far back as the 1940’s, Endebess Estate milled and processed its own coffee as well as neighboring small producers. It used to be owned and managed by Mr. E.W. D’Ollier, and in 1976 it was sold to Gatatha Farmers Co Ltd. and then sold again in 2011 to its current owner and manager, Kaitet Tea Plantations.

To help farmers best achieve the highest quality coffee production, the cooperative has invested in a spectrum of infrastructure to assist farmers. In addition to a 840 square meter warehouse, the cooperative has 7,000 square meters of drying space (patios, raised beds and parabolic dryers), a manual sorting table and a Huller.
Arisarina Cooperative is melding traditional Indonesia coffee growing techniques with choice tidbits from wider coffee cultivation practices. The cooperative encourages farmers to use shade trees, a practice not widely seen in Indonesia. At the same time, cooperative members maintain traditional techniques such as intercropping 2 or more varieties on the same small plot.
After handpicking cherry, farmers process their cherry using the traditional wet hulling (giling basah) method. Following harvest, cherry is pulped at or near the farm, on small hand-cranked or motorized pulpers. The coffee is fermented for approximately 12 hours (in small tanks, buckets or bags) and washed with clean water the following morning. Parchment is sun-dried for between half a day and two days, depending on the weather, to allow for skin drying which eases the removal of parchment.
At this point the moisture content is between 30-40%. Farmers deliver their parchment to Arisarina Cooperative. The cooperative become an essential part of the process here because a wet hulling machine, though slightly different, requires a similar investment to a dry huller. Wet hullers are larger, require more power and run at a faster speed than a traditional dry huller. Few, if any, individual farmers have their own hullers.
After hulling, the coffee seed is whitish and pliable and is called labu. It is laid out to dry on tarps or patios, where it reduces in size and moisture decreases to 14-15%.  This stage the green coffee is known as asalan—unsorted and with defects.   Much of the internal commercial trade is for asalan.   Exporters, most of whom are based in Medan, will typically finish the drying down to 12-13%, sort and prepare for shipment.
At the cooperative’s facility the parchment coffee is dried and sorted before being dry milled and prepared for export. Small quantities of natural, fully washed and honey coffee are produced, mainly for local cafes and roasters in the specialty coffee market. The cooperative’s coffee is certified USDA and EU organic and Fairtrade.",https://www.bodhileafcoffee.com/collections/green-coffee/products/indonesia-sumatra-arisarina-mandheling-wet-hulled-green,8.45,2025-02-15T06:45:55.203Z,bodhi_leaf,true,,"&nbsp; Tobacco, Roasted Almond, Dark Chocolate"

 US grown coffee is a bittersweet topic amongst a lot of coffee roasters, but you probably know that. The people growing coffee here usually have a great understanding of how to grow great coffee, they just don’t have the elevation that Ethiopia does for example. The same goes for this coffee, but what we’ve been getting excited about as roasters these last few years has not been finding coffee from the highest mountain ranges, but in the improving area of coffee processing. Farmers and mills have been focusing on coffees that have historically scored relatively low, and processing them so well that the cup quality far exceeds expectations.

El Platanillo History
In 1977, Mr. Samuel Coto Escobar purchased Finca El Platanillo and managed it until 1985. In 1985 the farm management was passed to Mr. Samuel’s youngest son, Mr. Stuardo Coto. Since then, management has focused on the ecosystem, the community, coffee quality and productivity. At Finca El Platanillo, Stuardo has managed to promote and perpetuate environmentally friendly practices which are not only compliant with current day certifications, but with his own personal quest to find the balance between the ecosystem and a productive high quality coffee plantation as one wholesome unit. Close monitoring of flora and fauna has allowed for the rich environment of the region to thrive in the farm. Protecting the ecosystem is a principle that has guided all the constant improvement that the farm undertakes each year. Because this principle was always priority, by the time certification programs such as RFA (Rainforest Alliance), Starbucks’ “Café Practices”, 4C, etc. came into existence, Finca El Platanillo was already in compliance with most of the requirements to obtain these certifications. El Platanillo has been certified by Rainforest Alliance since 2005. At one point even pioneering what was RFA’s Climate Module as the first farm in the world to implement this once extra sustainable program that is currently part of RFA’s standard requirements. The community of people who live in the farm has access to their own garden to grow vegetables, and fresh water flowing form the 7 water springs in the farm is also provided to people living in the farm, and also the nearby communities. Education has also been at the top of priorities at Finca El Platanillo. The farm had a simple school teaching grade school classes inside the farm for children who lived there since the farm was first started around 1978. In 2002 along with the help of long-term clients, the Nuevo Platanillo School was opened as a project to provide education to children of El Platanillo and also to children from the neighboring communities who wanted to learn. The school is located on land originally donated by the farm, very close to different communities. This project has continuously evolved, and the school building has been upgraded many times. A fully connected computer lab providing Internet access to all the children is used to teach the basics of computing from an early age. Most recently, the farm has engaged in pioneering a new education program in conjunction with Funcafe (Anacafe’s social arm) which was awarded SCA Sustainability Award in 2017. The project’s name is “Bachillerato en Ciencias y Letras con Diplomado en Café” and for this program El Platanillo and its sister farm El Panorama are host farms providing space to run small plantations, housing for the students, along with expert advice and access to coffee professionals. Through the years, a few graduates from this program have joined specific projects within the Coto family’s farms, and many are still working with us. Regarding the coffee itself, high quality and productivity have always been the goal. For many years, Stuardo, has been constantly studying and researching varietals that will adapt at El Platanillo’s specific conditions. Rainfall in El Platanillo is considerably above average for Guatemala, and thus, not all varieties adapt well to the microclimate. For this reason, many years ago he started a varietal garden where all varietals (around 150 different ones by 2021) are deeply studied both for their production capabilities, adaptation to the microclimate, and most importantly cup characteristics. Varieties that are found ideal for the farm are thoroughly tested and then plotted as a new plantations. Along with varieties, much research has been done regarding processing. Keeping in mind the high environmental cost of water usage, natural process has been selected as part of the main processes to research in order to standardize less use of water in coffee processing at El Platanillo. El Platanillo’s quality control, led by Samuel Coto, son of Stuardo, has been evaluating data from all processes with the many varieties tested in order to determine a recipe for achieving the best attributes in cup while still using less resources to process the coffee. After 10 years of selecting and re selecting the best plants from an original group of Geisha plants the team at El Platanillo managed to select from many different processes, a single coffee lot to be a competitor in the Cup of Excellence competition in 2020 effectively placing on 10th place for Guatemala’s best coffee.

The average farm size in Vietnam is very small, averaging 1-3 hectares. However, these small farms have great productivity compared to average coffee farms in Central America. To add additional value at the farm lever, particular focus is put on quality. This starts with picking only ripe coffee cherries, ensuring speedy delivery to the mill and getting a higher premium paid for red cherry. Coffee growers in Vietnam have typically strip picked the plants when the C market is favorable so incentivising growers to pick only ripe cherries can be a challenge.

For most roasters, that roast level occurs during the last trailing pops of first crack. If you are looking to pull even more crisp acidity out of the cup, go a little lighter, or as 1st crack is beginning to trail off. Be careful as this coffee is easy to under develop. You'll know you need to push the roast a little more if the cup tastes a bit vegetal, empty bodied and/or the acidity is unpleasantly harsh. At darker roasts, from 2nd crack on, the milk chocolate will become more like dark chocolate and you’ll get an increase in body from the cup, but you’ll lose a bit of acidity as a tradeoff.

List & Beisler - ""Tanzania stuns with fascinating wildlife, cultural abundance, and natural superlatives ranging from a spectacular coastline and the Serengeti savannah to the snow-peaked Kilimanjaro. Ever since the early 1900s, Tanzania has been keeping an eye on preserving its natural beauty. Today, about one-third of the country‘s territory is official national parks or conservation areas. Amidst this scenic diversity, some of the finest African coffees with complex cups and lively acidity are found here. Arabica coffee makes up about 70 % of Tanzania‘s coffee production and is mostly produced on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro in the north and in the southern highlands of Mbeya and Ruvuma. There, coffee trees are commonly intercropped with banana trees, wrapping the land in shades of lush green. 
Just as impressive as the country‘s natural wealth is its warm-hearted and hospitable people who live from Tanzania‘s natural abundance to a significant extent. Agriculture is the main source of income. While larger estates account for only 10% of the coffee produced, 90% of coffee grows on smallholder farms. Coffee cultivation is still manual labor, ensuring that only the ripest cherries are hand-picked. This coffee from the south of Tanzania is a handcrafted coffee where the hard labor is reflected in a fine cup with intense fruity notes - a cup profile Tanzanian Peaberry coffees are famous for. Peaberry refers to pea-shaped beans where only one seed rather than two forms inside the coffee fruit. Branded under the List + Beisler name Nyasi Furaha, this cup profile stands for a pleasant citric and full cup paired with notes of dark chocolate fudge, lemon zest, and cassis.”",List & Beisler,"Tanzanian Peaberry has become a household name in the specialty coffee world. Despite making up only 5-10% of coffee cherries harvested, this little naturally occurring mutation is in higher demand than all other sorting sizes. Tanzania has more than 10 recognized coffee grades including the elusive triple A, but when coffee folks hear Tanzania, our minds immediately jump to peaberry. That’s some Juan Valdez level marketing!

For fans of Tanzania Peaberry, there’s really nothing quite like it for that combo of gentle citric acidity, silky texture and subtle sweetness. At its best, it’s also got excellent balance and a clean finish. Which is exactly how I’d describe this cup! The cup opens up with some fresh lemon zest – not too much – just enough to add vibrance to the rest of the cup. Next up we noted buttery almond and amaretto along with cherry and milk chocolate.

In the cup we noted big tones of cocoa powder and black tea along with sweet honey, crisp lime and even a dash of watermelon.","Grower: Smallholder farms in the Kerinci Valley of West Sumatra
List & Beisler - ""Coffee cultivation in Indonesia goes back to the late 1600s to the Dutch colonial period and has played an essential role in its growth ever since. Today, over 300 years later, Indonesia ranks among the world‘s largest coffee producers, cultivating both Arabica and Robusta. The vast majority of coffee is grown by smallholder farmers with rarely more than 2 hectares of land. Indonesia consists of around 18,000 islands, of which ten major islands emerged as coffee-producing regions. 
Sumatra‘s westernmost island is crossed by the equator, featuring landscapes of unparalleled beauty and wildlife as spectacular as one can imagine. This coffee comes from central Sumatra, from the region around Kerinci Seblat National Park. The area is home to a lush tropical rain forest and one of the Sumatran tiger‘s last strongholds. Mount Kerinci, the country‘s highest volcano with an elevation of 3,800 meters, dominates the scenery. Once adventurers climb the summit, they have fantastic views of forested valleys and a patchwork of verdant farmland. Encircling the mountain, smallholder farms in the Kerinci highlands benefit from high altitudes and fertile volcanic soil. Kerinci has obtained a reputation in the specialty coffee market thanks to its high quality. Arabica production in Sumatra is mainly associated with the wet-hulling process.
This particular micro-lot, however, is a natural processed one. After being sorted by hand, the coffee cherries are carefully dried in the sun, resulting in a very sweet cup with fruity and winey notes.""",List & Beisler,"One of the most common misconceptions about coffee is that origin (where the coffee came from) is the main factor that determines the coffee’s flavor. But I actually think it’s the 2nd most important factor because time and again, I’m amazed at how much the processing can completely change the flavor of coffee. If you are looking for an example, this coffee is the perfect one!

The vast majority of coffee from Indonesia is processed in the local tradition called “Giling Basah” or wet-hulled. It’s very mechanically similar to fully washed processing common in the rest of the world but with one big twist – the coffee isn’t fully dried in its protective parchment. Now don’t read this wrong, this process can be done well and at its best, imparts a tasty cup with dominant notes of spice, earth and complex dark chocolate. But it is a very distinctive flavor that folks either love or hate. The misunderstanding I see most often is that this is simply the flavor profile you get with ALL coffee from Indonesia. But what if we simply change the process to natural?

The product is a coffee wholly unique from any other Sumatran you’ve ever tasted. In fact, it doesn’t even taste like most natural processes! The cup is shockingly clean without any of the earth tones and only the barest whisper of spice. The chocolate is still there, but it’s much more of a sweet and gentle chocolate which we noted as cocoa powder. Most striking is the difference in acidity – wet hulled coffee is always very muted, but this natural process has a vibrant lime note! We even noted subtle hints of watermelon and strawberry, though I certainly wouldn’t call this coffee a fruit bomb.  Finally, there’s a black tea undertone throughout the cup that reminds us of washed Ethiopian coffee. All in all, this coffee is very unique and will completely change your perspective of what Sumatran coffee can taste like.",https://thecaptainscoffee.com/collections/green-coffee/products/sumatra-kerinci-natural-grade-1,,2025-02-14T23:31:44.700Z,captain_coffee,false,Harvest season: 2024,"Acidity & Brightness: Gentle acidity and fair sweetness

The low acidity makes Sumatra Mandheling a great option for people with acid sensitivities. The Catimor and Typica coffee plants harvested for the natural almond, chocolate, and lemongrass notes are enhanced by wet-hulling and sun drying the coffee beans. While there is increased experimentation among processing methods in Indonesia, the cultural predominance and economic advantages of wet hulling continue to permeate the region giving its unique flavors.""",De La Finca Coffee,"Sumatran coffee has been a staple for decades and sourcing it is pretty easy since Indonesia is one of the biggest coffee exporters in the world.

The coffee we chose for this experiment comes to us direct trade - straight from one of De La Finca’s family farms, Finca La Esmeralda. We’ve processed this coffee in several different ways (all featured here on our site) but for this experiment we chose our fully washed version. It’s clean yet flavorful with lots of body, so it seemed like the perfect candidate to see how the barrel aging process impacted the cup. Before aging, we got sweet and clean notes of peach, pear, florals and cocoa powder.

After aging, it definitely took on some of the flavors you’d expect from the wood as well as the scotch and bourbon flavors that soaked into the wood. The cup is still sweet but now it’s a more caramel character along with that sweet and boozy oak tone. There’s a dark chocolate to bittersweet chocolate tone depending on your roast level along with a touch of vanilla. It’s exactly what you’d imagine: a tasty coffee with scotch and bourbon notes but without the alcohol! So give it a try and let us know what you think - This is a very limited run, but we plan to keep iterating this process and trying new things so tell us what you think of this batch!",https://thecaptainscoffee.com/collections/green-coffee/products/honduras-finca-la-esmeralda-bourbon-barrel-aged,16.99,2025-02-14T23:31:06.707Z,captain_coffee,true,"Harvest year: 2024,","Acidity & Brightness: Slightly bright and slightly sweet

De La Finca Coffee - “During the pandemic, we decided to look for areas we could innovate.
Enter → our honey decaf.
Typically, only lower scoring, washed process coffees are what are sent to be decaffeinated—because why would anyone want to decaffeinate a good coffee, right?
With a recent rise in popularity of decaf coffees, we decided to profile a particular honey process (higher quality processing method) coffee from a collective of farmers in the Marcala region then we sent it to Descamex in Vera Cruz, Mexico where it was organically decaffeinated using pure water from Pico de Orizaba (without use of chemicals).
At first, Descamex thought it was a defect coffee. They said it had turned out badly (they were used to tasting lower quality, decaffeinated coffees). We were surprised... so Nelson flew down to Vera Cruz himself to try the outcome of our experiment... when he arrived, low and behold, the coffee was actually REALLY good. It was so good, in fact, that it almost didn't taste like decaf!
We started bringing in this coffee in 2020 and it's been sold out 2 years in a row now. There are very limited quantities available because it's in such a popular coffee across the country.
While we were always confident it was an excellent decaf, we just weren't sure how it would hold up in competition until it took 1st Place in the Golden Bean North America for the Decaf Category.",De La Finca Coffee,"Folks, get ready for another TCC first! This is our FIRST EVER Direct Trade Decaf! It’s also, organic, Smithsonian bird friendly AND honey processed. It won 1st place in the Gold Bean North America’s Decaf category. Wow! *Pause for applause* You’re right, this IS an impressive feat! One we owe solely to our good friends over at De La Finca Coffee. And we’re so honored to share their accomplishment with you!

This might come as a surprise, but choosing to have a portion of your coffee harvest decaffeinated is a very risky business decision. It’s expensive, it’s time consuming and it caters to a very small portion of coffee buyers. That’s why most producers only commit their mid to bottom tier beans to decaffeination, stuff they would have had to sell super cheap anyways. But not De La Finca. They pulled from their best beans and kicked it up a notch with careful honey processing determined to create a decaf worthy of the DLF Marcala name.  In fact, when this coffee arrived at Descamex’s Mountain Water Decaf facility, they thought there had been a mistake and they had been sent the wrong coffee! Nope, that’s the bean alright. And it went on to take 1st place in Gold Bean North America’s decaf competition!

And lemme tell ya, it’s taken the top slot for our decaf favorite around the warehouse. We always try to keep a decaf roasted up on hand, you know, in case we feel like sleeping later on in the evening, and this one is new regular. The cup is incredibly clean, balanced and delightfully sweet, without being over the top sweet. The body is nice and full with a creamy texture that works great hot or iced.

Since Finca la Esmeralda is a base for DLF’s experimental processing testing, it’s no surprise this coffee is a double fermentation anaerobic natural. For this offering, a select blend of Caturra and Typica cherries undergo a 19-hour fermentation process. After the cherries are harvested, they’re put into GrainPro bags to ferment for 7 hours, then transferred to barrels where they’re completely cut off from oxygen for 12 hours. This is the anaerobic portion of the fermentation. Afterwards, they are left to dry on raised African beds. The result is a cup that’s intensely sweet and fruity without any of the harsh, vinegary flavors associated with less thoughtful anaerobic processes. We tasted big notes of watermelon, grape, raspberry, and honeydew. There’s also a fairly bright acidity coming from the fruity flavors as well. As you’d expect from a natural, it’s moderately balanced with full-body, creamy texture, and a fairly clean finish. If you liked our previous double ferment from DLF (which was a 72-hour double ferment), we found this offering to be very similar!

Delmer took full responsibility for maintaining the land and workers while Joel decided to go to college to study agricultural engineering and specialize in coffee. They have joined forces to make Finca el Conejo one of the few experimental coffee farms in the Comayagua region.”",De La Finca Coffee,"The Banegas brothers aren’t like family to us, they are family! Joel and Delmer’s farm, Finca El Conejo, is one of the few experimental coffee farms in the Comayagua region of Honduras and they are out to make waves. With 5 generations of coffee farming and degrees in Agricultural Engineering behind them, every lot is a microlot and every microlot is a chance to try something new and delicious. With this microlot, their goal was to elevate the humble Catuai variety.

Catuai is a variety usually sought after for its more “conventional” attributes – chocolatey, nutty and creamy. It cleans up well when fully washed, but usually gets stuck under that boring category of being a great blender, since not much stands out on its own. So the brothers decided to carefully dry process it and really let the bean shine. The result is a super clean cup that’s gently bright and sweet with excellent body and a nearly velvety texture. Instead of the usual intensely fruity profile from natural processing, you still get those conventional washed flavors – sweet milk chocolate, almond and honey – but with the added bonus of gentle dried fruit, apple and even hibiscus. I think of it as a natural for folks who like washed coffee!

De La Finca Coffee - ""Finca Santa Lucia is tucked away in the little village of Tres Pinos, over two and half hours away from the nearest city, Comayagua, Honduras. Raul Rodriguez, a third-generation coffee producer, owns and operates the farm and lives there happily with his wife and three dogs. He inherited this farm from his father, Don Ermenegildo Rodriguez—one of the biggest coffee innovators of his time. Having a vision for specialty coffee, his father introduced the world to exotic varietals such as Yellow Bourbon, Typica, and Caturra. 
Perfectly planted in Montaña de La Choca, a national mountain reserve, Finca Santa Lucia is surrounded by a cloud forest full of exotic wildlife. The well-defined seasons in this region contribute to the high quality of specialty coffees. The rainy season results in beautiful cherries, and the clear, dry season allows the producers to sun-dry their coffee once it is washed. The high altitude, richness of the clay, soil, and warmth of the sun ensure that the integrity and quality of the beans are preserved from beginning to end. 
As a coffee producer, Raul Rodgriguez is always pushing for better quality coffee and better quality of life for his workers. In the highest altitudes of his land, you will see him farming new coffee varietals, Ovata and Pacamara. His new farm, Santa Lucia Reserve, is certified organic and a habitat for many birds, including his favorite—the Toucan.  
This farm employs around 75 pickers during coffee harvest season and 15 permanent workers that live on the farm with their families. As a socially conscious coffee producer, Raul pays his workers the highest salaries in the region. This year, he will donate part of his profits from all of his direct sales to help rebuild the local school that is in dire need of a kitchen and electricity. 
Relationship with the De La Finca Family: 
Raul Rodriguez is one of the patriarch of the De La Finca Family. He is the grandfather of De La Finca Coffee founder/owner, Nelson Amador.",De La Finca Coffee,"We’ve been really enjoying the direct trade coffees from De La Finca’s family farms and figured its high time we introduced their “gold standard”. Finca Santa Lucia is their bread and butter family farm, owned and operated by Raul Rodriguez. Raul is the grandfather to De La Finca’s founder, Nelson Amador (pictured together above). He’s a third generation coffee producer who was raised on Finca Santa Lucia and inherited it from his father, Don Ermenegildo Rodriguez. Now that’s the legacy of a farmer who produces a gold standard!

The majority of Finca Santa Lucia’s best cherries are processed and sorted for De La Finca’s “Family” lot, but the very best ones are processed separately for this “Reserve” lot. Curated under Raul’s watchful eye, this lot once again leaves us wondering why Comayagua is such an underrecognized coffee region. Maybe it’s just a well-kept secret? Or maybe it’s tough to pronounce? Well that doesn’t make sense, Guatemala’s Huehuetenango region is near impossible for most folks to pronounce. Speaking of which, if you’re a fan of coffees from Huehue, this might be your new favorite.

This coffee is rich, bold and buttery with a touch of complexity and just a dab of bite. Smooth but not too smooth, there’s just enough kick to make it perfect for cutting through milk in a latte or for folks who prefer a bit of cream and sugar in their daily driver.

I promise, it tastes nothing like bread, or yeast or whatever bakery influenced taste your mind is conjuring. You see, all coffee undergoes a period of fermentation at the very beginning of processing. Traditionally, this is a very short period intended to allow wild yeast just floating in the environment to get to work breaking down the flesh and mucilage of the coffee cherry, which aids in the rest of processing. Depending on the length of fermentation, this period can also add quite a bit of flavor and intensity to the final product, but it can be difficult to control. By adding exactly the kind of yeast and amount of it that a producer wants, they’re able to exert more fine control over the cup’s flavor and acidity. And don’t worry, the friendly, helpful yeast that made all this possible is long gone by the time the coffee finishes processing!

These are farmers which we might just as easily call “homesteaders” today. They have small plots of land, a few hectares (1 hectare = 2.5 acres) at most, and they aren’t able to grow enough coffee to bring their coffee to international markets. So these smallholders often form cooperative groups with their neighbors to increase their combined crop size and thus their ability to bring their coffee to the market. Thus, groups like the Dannissa Farmer’s Group came to be.

Named for a local umbrella-like tree which provides shade for coffee plants, the Dannissa Farmer’s Group continues to practice old school cultivation methods: hand-picked, hand tilled and without chemical pesticides. With the help of local export experts Sookoo Coffee, organic certification was a breeze and we can now enjoy the fruits of their labor! Their generational coffee knowledge shines through in the cup.

They worked together to improve the quality of their coffee, for example by testing different varieties and perfecting their post-harvest processes. Efforts that bore fruit, because in 2015 they finished 8th in the Cup of Excellence. This is quite an achievement, because over 1,000 coffees were competing, and a good indication of the exceptional properties of their terroir. 
 Sadly, Afranio’s life fell apart when he learned that his son had died. The farm was abandoned for over two years before his daughter, Laura, took it over. There are still far too few companies managed by women in this country. Nowadays, Laura oversees all the commercial and marketing areas. While Don Afranio likes to be on the ground with the pickers, bringing them food, being aware of all the field duties, and running the business by his daughter’s side.

Located in southern Tolima in a region called Planadas, it was owned and managed by Don Afranio Enciso and his son for many years.

Considering there were thousands of entrants that year, I would have been impressed if they’d placed top 50, so placing in the top 10 is incredible. But it was at the height of his career that Don Enciso’s whole world would come crashing down with the tragic death of his son.

In his grief, he retreated from coffee and his farm was left abandoned for 2 years. But his daughter, Laura Enciso, refused to allow Finca La Leona’s story to end in tragedy. So she rolled up her sleeves and after years of hard work, has rebuilt La Leona and her family’s legacy.

De La Finca Coffee - ""Dario Delgado has been a coffee producer since 1998, focusing much of his production on organic farming. After several years in the coffee growing industry, Dario and his daughter, Iliana, started working together towards focusing on specialty coffee production.
In 2015, Dario decided to start a new company with two farms growing Castillo variety but now following a tailored made specialty production process. In 2022, they celebrated their fourth harvest of these coffees following the new specialty protocols which also allowed them to test the consistency of these coffees in the process.
This year, the total production in both farms came close to 5 containers, 1375 bags. For the first time, Dario is allowing Iliana to fully manage both the farm processing and the commercial offerings abroad. It is a goal for Iliana and the family to accomplish direct trade partnerships for all of their coffees — being owners of the complete supply chain from the farm to the port.
Processing:
Dry cherry stabilization for 12 hoursFermentation of de-pulped cherries for 24 hoursMechanical drying in silo at 40 degrees celsius for 36 hours (pre-dry 16 hours and full drying 12 hours)Milling and sorting starting in November
The Delgado's farms are located in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. La Esperanza Farm is a small plot of land reaching about 1650m. Coffee trees are planted under native tree shade.
Due to climate conditions, the trees get natural cloud coverage everyday. These weather conditions allow for coffee cherries to ripen slowly and consistently until the harvest season which is concentrated once a year between October and February.
Coffees are harvested at the optimal ripening point manually by a group of pickers that are hired every year. Almost 70% of the pickers return each year for the harvest. Once the cherries are picked, they are taken to the beneficio (mill) where they are first sorted with a mechanical washer, separating immature and dried cherries from perfectly ripened cherries. 
After ripe cherries are clean, they are transported to a stainless steel silo where they initially ferment for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the coffees are mechanically de-pulped and then fermented again for another 24 hours. The wet parchment is then washed in an eco washer that uses centrifugal force to remove the last remainders of pulp from every seed. 
Once fully washed, the coffee is transported to mechanical silos where they are slowly dried for almost 50 hours. Afterwards, the dry coffee (in parchment) is stored in 40kg jute bags and kept in warehouses in the farm for about 3 weeks before they are transported down to the dry mill.
Once in the dry mill, coffees get an initial QC evaluation and assigned a storage location depending on how quickly these must be processed for export. All of the coffees are milled and sorted carefully to maintain physical and sensory standards. It also helps that the mill is strategically located only 15 mins away from the Santa Marta Maritime Port. This allows for them to quickly respond to direct trade customers and move milled coffee directly and safely to port.”",De La Finca Coffee,"We’re excited to keep expanding our lineup from De La Finca Coffee importers and this coffee from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range in Colombia is no exception. This selection is Castillo variety only grown by father and daughter duo Dario & Iliana Delgado on their farm La Esperanza. Dario has been a long-time coffee producer since 1998 and when Iliana joined years later, they started focusing their efforts more on specialty coffee production. In 2015, they began a new adventure growing Castillo only variety on two of their farms and this is the fourth harvest of consistently reliable crop/product with the new specialty coffee protocols in place.

Castillo is now the most common coffee variety grown in Colombia, replacing the country’s Typica and Bourbon crops. It is a hybrid variety of Caturra with Timor that was carefully designed to be less resistant to leaf rust, unlike its counterpart Caturra. It’s suitable to grow in high density climates because it’s a “dwarfed” tree (meaning it’s compact) and it yields an abundant amount of coffee cherries, so it’s a popular choice for producers. How does this translate in the cupping characteristics? On one hand, it does have the potential to score highly in cupping evaluations; on the other hand, some in the specialty coffee realm think because it shares a genetic heritage with Robusta-Arabica beans that it is lower quality.

We beg to differ; we think you can have the best of both worlds and this coffee proves it.

Two years ago, I had the opportunity to acquire the La Manoa farm, which, along with my parents, was a dream we had in mind. We ventured into different coffee varieties, and thus we ban this challenge together with their great support. My father has taught me about processes and quality, as he has been in this world for 10 years. Today, I thank God for having my father and mother, who have taught and encouraged me to advance the project as a family. I have always lived in Planadas, Tolima. All my coffee knowledge is due to my parents, who have taught me about processes and quality through their farm. My vision for the farm is to develop a company that can offer excellent coffee in various presentations and quantities to customers. Regarding my work as a producer, I aim to maintain the farm’s traditional practices while protecting the local flora and fauna. This includes implementing conservation practices and ensuring a clean, environmentally friendly production process.’ 
The farm has 19 hectares of which approximately half is planted with coffee. It’s located in Planadas, Tolima in the Los Alpes village. The farm was founded 50 years ago and has always been under the ownership of a single person. The name “La Manoa” comes from the Latin verb “manus”, which signifies union and hope. Additionally, in the Bible, the word “Manoa” is associated with a land abundant in bread and honey.”",Belco,"José Edwin is a young producer with big dreams. Working under his father’s mentorship, he purchased Finca La Manoa only 2 years ago, yet he’s already producing world class coffee. Armed with the tools of modern agronomy mixed with a background in traditional farming and sheer will, his passion for high quality coffee is infectious. He’s got a long career in coffee ahead of him and we can’t wait to see where he goes from here!

Our first lot from José is an ambitious one – the bright and flowery Geisha variety. If you’ve never tried Geisha before, it’s lineage is traced all the way back to heirloom Ethiopian varieties. When processed fully washed, it’s got many of the same qualities as those high end washed Ethiopian coffees: effervescent acidity, a bouquet of florals and a crystal clean finish. The main difference you’ll find, especially with Geisha from Colombia, is so much more body. Unlike its Ethiopian counterpart, which is tea-like and almost delicate, Colombian Geisha has some real weight to it.

José took things one step further – he added some extra processing magic to really make this Geisha unique. After an extended double fermentation, once while in cherry then even longer after pulping, he double washed it. The fermentation stages develop and then balance the sweetness and acidity while the double washing clarifies the cup. The result is a coffee that’s got a lovely mix of florals, everything from coffee blossom to honeysuckle, along with the zesty acidity of tangerine and lime. We also noted fresh white grape and just a touch of blackberry in the cup which finishes super clean and leaves you wanting more!",https://thecaptainscoffee.com/collections/green-coffee/products/colombia-finca-la-manoa-geisha-double-washed,16.99,2025-02-14T23:28:58.417Z,captain_coffee,true,"Harvest year: 2024,","Acidity & Brightness: Zesty bright and gently sweet.

Odds are you have and didn’t know it, though almost certainly as a part of a variety blend. Its lineage can be traced back 4 or 5 generations ago when farmers where hoping to combine the high yield, disease resistant and tasty cup qualities of the Caturra variety with the nearly coffee leaf rust immune Timor variety. The result is a workhorse hybrid that despite sometimes being credited with saving the Colombian coffee industry during outbreaks of coffee rust leaf, often goes overlooked in the world of high end coffee. But at his farm El Marchito in the Indigenous Nasa Wesx community of Gaitania, producer Justiniano Paya decided it was high time the humble cultivar received recognition for also being capable of a world class cup.

So he sorted out his absolute best and most ripe Colombia cherries, gave them a whopping 120 hour anaerobic fermentation, then carefully washed and dried them in the shade. The result is a cup that I was convinced was a Bourbon or at the very least a Caturra. It’s bright yet soft like overripe citrus with notes of orange blossom, passion flower, tropical fruit and peach along with a white chocolate undertone. That might read as “intensely fruity and sweet” but the cup is so much more balanced than that. It’s sweet, certainly, but not juicy like a natural processed coffee.

Royal New York - ""Decaf Colombia Excelso EA Sugar Cane coffee is decaffeinated using Ethyl Acetate (EA). In this method the green beans are steamed or soaked to expand the beans for caffeine extraction. The expanded beans are then soaked in EA, a naturally occurring organic compound found in many fruits and vegetables which can be synthesized for coffee decaffeination. In the presence of EA, caffeine bonds with the compound and is drawn out of the bean. The decaffeinated coffee is then removed from the EA solvent, rinsed thoroughly, re-dried and re-bagged for transport.""",De La Finca Coffee,"Look, we get it, ""Death Before Decaf"" is a funny tagline for t-shirts, but you don't have to be particularly long in the tooth to understand that if you want to enjoy coffee all day, you're gonna have to get cozy with decaf. And for some folks, decaf is the only option no matter what time of day it is! These coffee enthusiasts are the truest coffee fanatics to us: they love coffee without the added benefit of an energy boost. For years now we've kept our decaf selections to Water Processed coffees, whether they be from the Canadian Swiss Water facility or the Mountain Water facility in Mexico. Compared to older decaf methods, water processed decaf is significantly more environmentally friendly and leaves behind, in our opinion, the best flavor profile post decaffeination. Well consider that opinion officially changed because there's a new competitor for that title now.

EA stands for Ethyl Acetate. It's a naturally occurring compound that's a byproduct of sugar cane processing. Sugar cane is found commonly in the wild and also grown alongside coffee by farmers, so the two go together like peanut butter and jelly. Explaining exactly how the EA decaf process works deserves it's own lengthy article (coming soon), but the big takeaway here is that it removes over 97% of the caffeine and leaves no EA on the coffee once the process is completed. What it does leave behind is potentially the truest cup profile we've tasted yet to conventional (caffeinated) coffee. Try it and let us know if you agree!

See overview for Farm Info",Keffa Coffee,"Despite its small size, Burundi has established itself among the coffee greats of Africa over the last few years. For better or worse, almost all coffee grown in Burundi is of the Bourbon variety which lends an unusual amount of dependability and consistency to the origin profile. The best cups of Burundi we’ve had are similar to those found in Ethiopia whose wild heirloom varieties gave birth to Bourbon. So it’s no surprise that if you enjoy good Ethiopian coffee, you’re gonna love a good cup of Burundi as well!

Masha washing station buys cherry from over 2,500 farmers in its community. If that number shocks you, it’s important to keep in mind that more than 80% of coffee farmers in Burundi are smallholders. These are folks who only have a couple hundred coffee trees which produce less than a pallet (10 bags) of specialty grade coffee each season. That’s too little to attract a suitable buyer, so community washing stations like Masha sort and blend the local crop in order to create large enough profile focused lots to export.

Community lots like this one are a great way for washing stations to craft a coffee that showcases the local terroir. This particular microlot was selected for anaerobic fermentation then finished with natural processing in order to highlight its inherent brightness and sweet, fruity flavor.

Sucafina - ""Kibingo washing station is in the province of Kayanza in northern Burundi. The station itself sits 1,893 meters above sea level. The altitude of the farms in the neighboring hills that supply the washing station varies from 1,700 to 1,900 meters above sea level. Kibingo serves 1,739 registered coffee growers, spread over 18 hills in the area. All producers registered at a Greenco washing station are organized in groups of 30 people, headed by a farm leader. This leader acts as a spokesman to facilitate communication and organization with the washing station. At the washing station, farmers can obtain organic fertilizer from composted coffee pulp. To promote farm renovation, producers can get low-cost, subsidized coffee seedlings at the washing station. Each station has its own nursery for this purpose. The washing station participates in a number of farmer outreach and support projects including a livestock rearing project and a range of Farmer Hub projects centered on strengthening cooperatives and improving yields. 
During the harvest season, all coffee is selectively hand-picked. Most families only have 200 to 250 trees, and harvesting is done almost entirely by the family. Cherry is placed in containers and Oro yeast purchased from the French company Lalcafe is added. The cherry is left to ferment in this environment for approximately 36 hours. After fermentation, cherry is carried to the drying tables, where they will dry slowly for 2-3 weeks, during which time the cherry is repeatedly sorted and sifted to ensure even drying. Cherry is left to dry from sunrise to sunset and is covered with a sheet during the evening or when it rains. The moisture level is carefully monitored and any cherry with visual defects is removed. Once dry, coffee is then bagged and taken to the warehouse. Greenco’s team of expert cuppers assess every lot (which are separated by station, day and quality) at the lab. The traceability of the station, day and quality is maintained throughout the entire process. 
Before shipment, coffee is sent to Budeca, Burundi’s largest dry mill. The coffee is milled and hand sorted by a team of hand-pickers who look closely at every single bean to ensure zero defects. It takes a team of two hand-pickers a full day to look over a single bag. UV lighting is also used on the beans and any bean that glows (which is usually an indication of a defect) is removed. The mill produces an average of 300 containers of 320 bags per year. 
Greenco, a company that oversees and structures washing stations in Kayanza province of Burundi, gives washing stations and producers support all along the production chain. They started their work in 2015, and have dominated all Cup of Excellence competitions in Burundi ever since. Currently, Greenco has 13 washing stations all located in Kayanza in the north of Burundi. The producers receive support from the Greenco CWS managers, who are all agronomic engineers. Greenco works with young agronomy graduates to provide farmer training and manage washing stations. Young graduates are particularly well suited for the work with Greenco because they can all work with computer systems, greatly simplifying the flow of information between the washing stations and Greenco. Also, they have a fresh and systematic approach to coffee production and processing, with up-to-date knowledge about farming practices. The agronomists received additional training from the NGO Kahawatu Foundation on best agricultural practices (BAP). Off season, they provide agronomy assistance to the roughly 15,210 farmers who deliver cherries to Greenco washing stations to prepare for the next harvest. 
Next to improving quality and productivity, Greenco strives to improve socio-economic and environmental conditions around the washing stations. All of their washing stations have UTZ and 4C certification. Greenco is buying 93% of its cherries directly from farmers via collection centers. This way, they improve farm-gate price to the producers. Washing stations make the first payment to farmers between 15 and 30 June. The second payment comes later in the summer. If the coffee wins a competition or sells for extremely high specialty prices, Greenco gives another payment approximately a year after the harvest season.“",Sucafina,"Yeast fermentation doesn’t sound like it’s got anything to do with coffee. Sure that makes sense for bread and wine, but coffee? Well if you’re new to coffee processing, prepare yourself for a shocker: ALL coffee is fermented with yeast . WHAT?! I know! So here’s the scoop – all coffee goes through a fermentation stage. Traditionally, this is a short period, maybe 6 to 12 hours, intended to break down the fruit covering those tasty beans so that it can be easily removed. But where does the yeast come from? Are you sitting down? Everywhere.  Yup, wild yeast from the environment just jumps in with the assist and never gets any credit. For shame.

But unlike beer and wine, coffee fermentation is often an uncontrolled process. That’s been changing the last decade or so as techniques like yeast cultivation and anaerobic fermentation (methods largely learned from the wine industry) have gained in popularity. In fact, there are laboratories like Lalcafe in France, cultivating yeast specifically designed for coffee fermentation! The variety the processing experts at Kibingo washing station chose for this lot is even trademarked: “Oro.” Oro is tailor made to intensify and enhance cup quality with longer fermentations, in this case, 36 hours.

The result is one of the juiciest cups of coffee I’ve ever had. My fruit flavor calls were pineapple, cranberry, and orange juice, but I could have easily tripled the number of fruits and added “juice” to the end of all of them. Maybe I should have just gone with “fruit cocktail”. On top of that, I got tasty notes of sweet red wine and a burst of passionflower. The cup is intensely sweet with a slightly funky finish. Fresh off the roaster it was a little funky, but the cup mellowed significantly with more rest, so don’t hesitate to let this one chill for a week or two before enjoying.

Most farms are less than 2 hectares in size, and farmers are intercropping other cash crops like corn, fruits, and beans, with coffee. This is a wet process coffee, meaning the cherries are pulped, and then the green coffee seeds are fermented overnight (12-17 hours) to break down the sticky mucilage fruit that will be washed away the following day.

Notes of winey plum, fruit liqueurs, dried stone fruit, woody cedar, and bergamot play off underlying bittersweetness. City to Full City+.","This coffee underwent a pretty interesting Anaerobic-Honey hybrid process that is no doubt behind the intense fruity flavors in the cup. The coffee cherries are first fermented in sealed bags for 72 hours, deprived of air. They then pulp the coffee, leaving behind a thin layer of fruit stuck to the seed for the drying stage. This is the ""honey"" part of the process, a name coined by Costa Rican coffee farmers who popularized the honey process method. When the layer of fruit dries, it oxidizes to a yellowish-red hue, and has the coloring of honey. Hence the name. At Turelelo, coffee dries in about 7 days, which is relatively fast. The owner of the Turelelo mill buy cherry from local collectors who act as intermediaries between small farmers from the nearby towns and the mill. It's worth noting the visual grade of the green coffee. We found several secondary defects, such as insect damage, pulper nicks, withered and chipped beans. We also found a dried cherry husk in the 1 lb. sample we pulled. All of that said, the review is based on the sample as it sat, which is to say we didn't remove any of the physical defects before roasting and cupping it (we did remove the cherry husk). The bottom line is that regardless of its appearance, the coffee cups very well! See photo of the green for reference.",Farm Gate,"This anaerobic process coffee is intensely fruited, with rustic-tinged, earthy aromatics that construct a wild and wooly cup profile to remember.

Turelelo's body is impressively plump, highlighting juicier fruit flavors that fade to notes of winey plum, fermented blackberry, natural dried stone fruits, and apricot liqueur.

It's on the smaller size in comparison, both in terms of physical and membership numbers, with 80 local farmers making up its base. Beshasha town has very good altitude, registering at just under 2100 meters above sea level. It is conveniently situated along the side of one of the main dirt road that runs through town, affording good access for moving coffee on and off the site. As a matter of fact, we made an unplanned visit to Birbirsa in 2019 on our way to another coop. The colorful sign, and colorfully dressed manager Mohammed, drew us in like a beacon on the side of the dusty road (that's Mohammed in the beautiful green shirt and tie in front of Birbirsa sign). During our tour of the site, we saw that the cherry selection looked great, and have hoped for an opportunity to buy their coffee ever since. It took a few years, but we finally were able to facilitate samples this harvest, and based on what we saw on our visit, were not surprised by the high quality they sent.

Our City and City+ roasts brought out smells of dried stone fruits, red berries, honey, and spices, along with some malt tones accenting the rest. The wet aroma showed a bounty of fragrant fruits and sweetness, darker stone fruits like plum, berry jams, and milk chocolate. These roasts brewed bright fruited flavors for dry process coffee, with stone fruit tones similar to some of the washed Western Ethiopian coffees we buy. Birbirsa is also on the ""cleaner"" end of the spectrum for our dry process coffees, and the cooling cup yielded a long list of flavor notes that were well defined, not too rustic.

In fact, his farm is located in the town of Genji Challa, a name you likely recognize as being linked to a cooperative of the same name. Aba Deressa (""Aba"" is a term of reverence that translates to ""father"") has an 8 hectare farm in Genji Challa, and is producing both wet and dry process coffee. The altitude at Aba Deressa's farm is 1980 to 2200 meters above sea level, and planted primarily in a variet from the Jimma Agricultural Research Center (""JARC""), simply identified as ""74112"". JARC is the government coffee research center, and responsible for breeding improved sub varieties from many of the heirloom local coffee strains. Currently, there are 42 different JARC types, and 74112 is a fairly common one to see planted, along with others, like 74110. For dry process coffee, I found this lot fairly easy to judge roast level by sight, though it does show a shade darker than a wet process coffee. This is typical for dry process coffees, and a result of some of the fruit being stuck to the seed after milling. You can also expect it to produce more chaff than your average wet process coffee, so be sure to vacuum your machine after roasting.",Farm Gate,"Aba Derese's coffee is a fruit-forward dry process coffee, with aromatic top notes, as well as complex earth tones in the background that brought to mind Harrar coffee while drinking it.

Adding hot water extracted a sweet smelling aroma of cobbler-type cooked fruits, berry and peach, with earthy raw cacao.

City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.","This year's buying was focused around coffee from four regions, Matari, Sharqui Haraz, Hajjah, and Hiwari, and this peaberry lot is a blend from all four areas. Peaberries occur naturally on every coffee tree, but in very small amount (typically < 5% of the harvest). What happens is, one of two embryos inside the coffee cherry fails to germinate, leaving the other behind to take on a rounded shape as it matures. They tend to be separated out from the regular ""flats"" during the dry milling process where coffee is separated by size using large mechanized screen sorters. At the end of our buying, Fatoum Muslot, who oversees operations at this source, asked us if we wanted to buy the peaberries that were separated out from each of the lots we purchased. What that means is, this peaberry lot is the same coffee as the others on our site, just the small peaberry beans that were sorted out from the rest. That fact really makes it an interesting counterpoint to any of the others we have. This lot was secured through Fatoum, who took over the Pearl of Tehama export business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, the lack of underripe coffee and shipping in Ecotact liners has really benefitted the resulting cup quality. During their long history in the coffee trade they've forged longstanding connections with farming groups in several growing regions, and because of these connections, are able to buy coffee in a more direct way. Altitude is extremely high in these areas, starting around 2000 meters and stretching upwards of 2400 meters above sea level. This It's been a few years now since we've picked up Yemeni coffee, not necessarily by choice, but mainly due to the difficulties exporting from a country at war. The situation there is still quite dire, and I'm amazed that anything is making it out of the country. Read our interview with Fatoum Mouslot from 2020.",Farm Gate,"This peaberry blend has a somewhat predictable cup profile, being that it's a blend of the smaller peaberry separation from the 4 lots we purchased this year (Harazi, Hawari, Hajah, and Matari). The scents I picked up on in the dry fragrance had a scent of baked goods, like zucchini bread with nuts, along rustic earth tones that settled into the sweetness nicely. The darker of the two roasts showed bittersweet cocoa smells as well, which led into a very appealing wet aroma too, with leathery accents, and umami hints. I'd steer clear of light City roasts, where the cup lacks the development needed for sweetness and body. Full City roasts really layer on the chocolate roast flavors in the cup, and comes off smokey and bittersweet when hot, cooling to some top note hints of burnt marshmallow, cooked pumpkin, and aromatic palo santo. Our City+ roast showed compelling sweet-savory combinations that brought to mind pumpkin bread, and hazelnut chocolate, and sesame cookie. Both roasts offered rustic underpinnings in the finish, like whole spice, tobacco, and aromatic woody accents.

In the scheme of things, Aulia's operation is quite small. He usually buys a few bags at a time, and then processes coffee with family at home. With small scale comes the capability for a high level of quality management, which he puts into all of the different process technics he employs (including full honey and dry process!). That extra care and attention given to quality control is apparent when you look at the green coffee, and of course in flavor too, both remarkably clean for a wet hulled coffee, though not without defects (learn more about the Giling Basah / Wet Hulled process). We're fortunate to have been buying Aulia's coffee for a few years now, paying premiums on top of the coffee cost to help pay for new processing infrastructure like raised beds for drying.

All that extra effort Aulia puts into quality control pays off in the brewed coffee. It made a super sweet cup at City+ roast level, with earth-toned, herbal aromatics just beneath the surface. Sweet flavors of brown rice syrup, and rustic coconut palm sugar provided a nice backdrop, as herbal suggestions crept up in the cup. There were also latent hints of fruit after the coffee cooled down some, like stewed plums, and even a bit of citrus that added a nice bright touch. Bittersweet roast tones underpinned the cup profile, especially in the darker roasts, and were accented by a foresty finish of woodsy spice notes.

We were able to visit Gitesi last year (2024), and saw many improvements to the mill, including a newer Penagos 1500 pulper that is used to process their top grades. When farmers deliver their cherries, it is first floated to remove any unripe coffee that floats to the top. The ripe coffee that sinks is processed by their new Penagos, while the coffee that floats is funneled to a differet pulper altogether. It's this kind of quality separation that helps Gitesi consistently produce some of the best quality we see out of Rwanda. More than 1,800 coffee farmers in the area supply Gitesi with cherries each year. The station fosters a relationship with the farmers by paying an additional dividend at the end of each season based on performance. Gitesi was started in 2005 and has been building capacity with each passing harvest. Like much of Rwanda, the coffee is Bourbon variety. We ""built"" this lot by looking at all their day lot batches and combining the best ones (""day lot"" = wet-process batches from coffee cherry received in a single day).

Ben first purchased the land from a man named Taro and they were amongst the first people to cultivate crops in these valleys. In 1965, the government encouraged the early settlers to start growing coffee as a long-term sustainable crop. Ben started to plant coffee trees becoming one of the first coffee producers of the Eastern Highlands The Colbran Family is now in its third generation with Ben's son Nichol and grandson Chris running Baroida plantation.

It's a cooperative setup where these different stations are aligned with farmer members, and the stations belong to a much larger cooperative society: in this case Othaya Farmers Cooperative Society (""FCS""). Rukira is one of several member stations, and is comprised of over 500 members delivering coffee cherry to the mill. The Othaya FCS started in the mid-1950s, ballooning from 250 original members to 15,000 strong today. Altitude of the washing station is just shy of 1900 meters, and you mostly see SL-28 and SL-34, along with a little Ruiru and Batian cultivars mixed in. This peaberry lot is fruited, bright, sweet, juicy - a real stunner Kenya. We generally buy three different out-turns from Kenya that are differentiated by bean size; the large AA beans, the medium size AB beans, and the rounded ""peaberries"", which make up a very small percentage of every harvest. To be clear, all of these different grades are separated from a single lot of coffee, and there's not always a huge difference in cup quality. Overall, I found this coffee to roast evenly, color quite uniform as you pass a City roast level.",Farm Gate,"The grounds showed a sweetness of complex sugars, with red raspberry, cola soda, and a sprinkling of baking spices.

The fruit-accented sweetness in the brew was very nice in both our City and City+ roasts, and I would not hesitate taking this coffee up to Full City. Kenyan coffees can be pretty berry-forward in the mid-roasts, and judging from the juicy flavors found in mine, I'd bet that Rukira really comes through at Full City. Light roasts had some tangy fruit flavors, pomegranate juice, dried mango, and grapefruit.

This area is one of the most well shaded that I've seen in Central America. The coffee trees are protected under an excellent canopy. Another unique aspect of this region is the heavy dose Typica varietals we've found planted among the Bourbon and Caturra.

When Alejandro Rosales bought the farm in 1963, the only way to get there was by foot, or horseback. It's not that easy of a trek by road, either. The farm is quite steep, typical for the high ridges of the Sierra Los Cuchumatanes mountains. I found the plantings to be quite a jumble of cultivars. There were certainly a lot of old Bourbon trees, but I saw many Typica (Arabigo), and some Caturra and Catuaí as well. There were red and yellow varieties too. Processing is mostly wet-process, traditional fermentation, but they are working with a very tight space; there is not a lot of flat areas in this topography. So they have to manage their batch sizes carefully or they will rapidly run out of patio space for sun-drying the coffee, though partially remedied with the addition of a large area of raised drying beds.

It's very cold in this area and they employ a long fermentation to break down the fruit mucilage stuck to the green coffee seeds. After the outer cherry is removed, the coffee is typically fermented with water for up to 36 hours, then soaked for another 24 hours in clean spring water, and sent to the raised drying beds.

Good for espresso.","The name ""Nano Challa"" refers to a local mythic tale about a challenge to become King of Jimma, and the coop adopted it to signify their desire to be a strong cooperative. Indeed, many coops in the West of Ethiopia have struggled to find good buyers who will pay enough for the coffee, to manage their own debts, and from internal struggles and graft. Nano Challa was formed as part of an initiative to aid farmers in a more comprehensive way, starting cooperatives that could be governed by the farmers, rather than selling their coffee to privately run mills, and 'middle men'. The program was administered by a non-government organization that not only coordinates agronomists and managers for each of the coops they work with, but also has a business adviser assigned that helps the cooperative manage their debt, re-invest in quality improvements at the mill, and verifies distribution of income to all members. They've since graduated from this program, and are now part of an independent, local Union called Kata Muduaga, who assist the cooperatives with functions like marketing, exporting, and general representation on an international scale. Nano Challa is a smaller cooperative coffee mill near Gera town in the Jimma region, Western Ethiopia. (The area also has some of the finest honey available in Ethiopia). This is from a collection site 2km from the original Nano Challa station called ""Genji Challa"".

While almost double last year's output, it was still just 11 bags. Pacamara is a hybrid cultivar of Pacas (natural mutation of Bourbon), and Maragogype.

We found this to be quite fruited for a wet process coffee, juicy, and sweet, putting it at the outside of the flavor range of our washed El Salvadorian coffees. It comes from the Miravalles farm in Ahuachapan, a 120 manzanas farm that is planted in many different varieties, including a small amount of Pacamara. Finca Miravalles is a family affair. It's owned by husband and wife Luis Duarte and Maria Teresa Chacón (""Tete""), and much of the management is handled by their son, Luis Jr, and Chico, the on-site manager of 15 years. The farm is located in Apaneca, Ahuachapan, not too far from the Santa Ana volcano. It used to be two separate farms, Miravalles belonging to Tete's family, Santa Maria to Luis's. They were both raised on these neighboring farms, family ownership going back some 150 years. Sometime after marrying, they put in an offer on Miravalles, which was all but abandoned at the time, and joined with Santa Maria under the Miravalles name. They have been renovating the farm ever since, keeping much of the original Bourbon and Pacas cultivars, and planting several other varieties, including H1 and F1 hybrids, Catimor, Pacamara, Caturra, and Gesha. They've done an amazing job segregating the cultivars in separate plots, and go to great lenghts to harvest and process separately too. Miravalles is perched on the verdant slopes of the Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain region, and spans an altitude range of about 1250 to 1550 meters above sea level. Check out our video tour of the Miravalles farm, and in-depth look at their wet process method in action at their mill.",Farm Gate,"Pacamara's are interesting cultivars for more reasons than just their large size.

The sweetness in the cup was prominent, like caramelized sugar, and torched desserts, and also had a hint of sesame oil wrapped within. A bright lime note adds to the acidic impression, and connects hints of herbal infusions in the nose. I've roasted this coffee pretty dark in the past, all the way up to 2nd Crack.

Miravalles is about 1500 meters above sea level. It's part of a much larger group of coffee plots, a few of them demarcated by cultivar separations, and the larger plots a mix of cultivars. Duarte has kept his farm planted in Bourbon and Pacamara for the most part, despite the susceptibility to leaf rust. Many farmers are replanting with disease resistant varietals, but Luis Duarte has chosen to continue with these cultivars because of the commonly held belief that they taste superior to most disease resistant hybrids available and manages to prevent leaf rust and fungal outbreaks with good farm practices (proper space between plants, regular pruning, cleaning beneath the trees, directive spraying, etc). Here lies one of the exceptions, a lot separation of the disease-resistant ""Tabi"". This cross between Bourbon, Typica, and Timor Hybrid, created at Colombia's agricultural research institute (""CENICAFE"") was produced to have the best of both worlds: disease resistance, and good cup quality.

City to Full City+. Good for espresso.","This coffee is from the Bonilla family's 'Don Mayo' micro mill. This is truly one of the oldest of the micro mills that started back in 2003, at the beginning of Costa Rica's micro mill revolution. The man behind Don Mayo mill, Hector Bonilla, has worked at perfecting production at the facility along with his sons. This particular lot is from La Loma, a farm in Leon Cortes de Tarrazu,. La Loma sits between 1750 and 1875 meters, and planted almost entirely in Caturra cultivar. They use a Penagos mechanically-washing at the station , efficient water conserving machine, dry parchment on raised beds, and then do all the dry milling themselves. That's part of the beauty of Familia Bonilla/Don Mayo mill, is their ability to oversee the coffee processing from the time it is harvested to the milled green coffee. Like many of the micro-mills, Don Mayo processes coffee from their own farms (such as La Loma), as well as buys whole cherry from local farmers to sell as individual micro-lots. This is a red honey process, which means that 50% of the fruit is left intact to the seed during the entire drying phase. That extra moisture from the fruit slows the drying process, and often imparts body, fruit, and round off acidity to some degree. It also leads to the coffee looking much darker when roasting, and produces a lot of chaff. It's not hard to roast, per se, but you should pay closer attention to time and the audible snaps, rather than physical coloring for judging roast degree.",Farm Gate,"This Red Honey lot from Don Mayo carries fruited undertones that co-mingle with densely bittersweet flavors, and complex nutty accents. The dry fragrance at City roast level has a pleasant scent of hazelnut chocolate spread, accented by dried pear, and toasted almond. The wet aroma is laced with vanilla and caramel, molasses cookies, and a spiced fruit note like apple butter. While City roasts certainly offer the brightest cups, I've really enjoyed the bittersweet backdrop that comes with a little more development, City+, or even Full City. It pairs well with the fruited top notes, and builds plump body too. As it cools, dark cocoa gives way to flavors of fermented cider, pear and apple. The cup has tangy acidity, like hibiscus drink, and is well integrated into the cup profile. The finish is long and bittersweet, and a tannic note of walnut accents the aftertaste. Full City+ roasts are intense with bittersweetness, a little too dark for brewed coffee in my opinion, but will double nicely as chocolate-y espresso or for milk drinks.",https://www.sweetmarias.com/costa-rica-red-honey-don-mayo-8027.html,8.20,2025-02-11T05:43:28.956Z,sweet_maria,true,,

The farmer who produced this lot, Edward Sandoval, worked for many years as a field technician for the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros (""FNC""). When he broke away from the FNC and set out to start his own farm, Finca Canta Ranas, he decided to plant varieties that were not promoted by the FNC due to their need for a higher degree of management, and disease susceptibility. But they are also quite capable of producing a higher value cup, which was what appealed to Edward. Since starting his farm, he's planted varieties such as Bourbon, Chiroso, Wush Wush, Gesha and Moka. Edward's farm is small, just 6 hectares planted in coffee, and stretches up to about 1900 meters above sea level. His background as a Q grader and cupper comes in handy during the harvest, and sees him cup testing each process batch he produces in order to separate quality. He wet processes his coffee into tile tanks where it ferments until ready to move to the patios. He mixes process batches over the course of 2-3 days, adding fresh water each day to slow the fermentation process. It's more common in Colombia than you might think and helps manage small lots on the drying patio. It also leads to some fruitier flavors, without going over the edge.",Farm Gate,"We picked up a few different variety separations from Edward Sandoval this past harvest, and are starting off strong with his Gesha. Gesha can present quite different depending on a lot of factors, but in our minds, should always be floral. Edward's coffee is certainly floral, and also carries a unique fruited side that brings a juicy aspect, and bright acidity to the cup. The dry fragrance has wisps of fresh flowers, red apple, and raw sugar cane. The wet aroma delivers saturated sweetness, more sugar cane notes, with a sweet floral overlay that's like honeysuckle flowers. Light roasts have jasmine flavor that's aromatic, and adds a freshness to the cup profile. It makes a moderate impression on the cup, and fairly well integrated, sitting pretty level with the sweetness. The coffee cools to notes of star fruit, winey pear, sugar in the raw, and some jasmine pearl green tea. There's also a brisk black tea brightness that really helps structure the cup. I don't recommend roasting this coffee dark, as you'll crowd out the aromatic flavors with roast tone. I did roast one batch to City+, and noted some of the fruits being a bit more pronounced.

As you make the drive from La Plata to Inzá, you follow the Río Páez, and an eventual crossing over a suspension bridge lands you on the road to the the villages of Inzá where this coffee was sourced. Like much of Colombia, Inzá is home to some very high altitude farms, many cresting 2000 meters above sea level. This particular lot is a blend of coffees from five farms in a few of the neighboring Veredas within the region, altitudes ranging from 1400 - 2000+ meters. The way we make up these regional blends is by cupping several samples from the individual farms, with a goal of separating out the best quality we can find. It's a great benefit to us (and not to mention the cup) having this level of control with our Colombian coffees, and allows us to take a quality-focused approach to constructing our regional blends, and single farm microlots too. The wet process (""washed"") style of processing coffee is traditional in the region, and many farmers use old hand cranked style pulpers, fermenting and washing the coffee seeds in the same tank, and then drying in covered drying rooms for upwards of two weeks. This last part is key in facilitating even and gentle drying of the parchment, not to mention protecting the coffee from passing rains. Most farms have a healthy amount of Caturra, Timor hybrids, like Variedad Colombia and Tabi, that were heavily promoted for disease resistance, and smaller amounts of Bourbon and Typica.",Farm Gate,"At City to City+ roast levels, the fragrance of the ground coffee displayed a blend of unrefined sugar and dried fruit sweetness, with notes of panela, dried plum, and a hint of hibiscus.

The wet process is typically associated with clean flavors, and more pronounced acidity, whereas wet hulling leads to the earthy, rustic flavors, and low acidity that Sumatra is known for. What happens when you remove the lens of rustic processing? This is a unique opportunity to find out. This coffee comes from Gunung Tujuh area, a higher elevation coffee zone around Mount Kerinci in Jambi Province. There's a cooperative of farmers that have banded together in this growing region, taking an interest in going beyond the traditional wet-hulled process, incorporating dry process, honey process and wet processing to their repertoire.

This is their fully-washed coffee, meaning they are pulping, fermenting immediately and moving wet parchment straight to the drying beds after rinsing away the remaining fruit. It's a gentler process than wet hulled, and results in a cleaner flavor profile, almost no earth tones at all, and acidity that's normally lacking in Sumatran coffee.

At just under 1500 meters, the milling site is at a much lower altitude than most of the coffee that comes in, many of the farms reaching above the 1800 meter mark. The station employs many grading techniques to separate out the top quality coffee, starting with the whole coffee cherry being submerged in tanks of water, and removing the low density coffee that floats to the top. The dry process coffee is then moved to raised drying tables where it will dry over the course of a few weeks. During this time, the cherry is turned by hand, and the workers continue to remove any coffee with physical defects they find along the way.

They only produce dry process coffee at Hambela Buliye, and are receiving coffee from 200 registered farmers, as well as from their own ""Buliye"" farm nearby. They are mostly buying coffee from farmers in the surrounding kebeles of Buliye, Wamana, Borticha, Dari Rogicha and Dabaye. What's interesting about having a site that only produces naturals, is that you're not tied to a water source for processing coffee, and can build them very high in the mountain. Buliye rests in a very high altitude zone of around 2150-2200 meters above sea level, and the farms are planted at a wider range. On our last visit in 2024, we noticed there wasn't a lot of direct sunlight on the beds, which led to longer drying times of around 3-4 weeks. This year's coffee is as fruited as ever, and displays very nice level of acidity too, not always the case with natural processed coffee.",Farm Gate,"Fruit notes are bountiful in the dry fragrance, with potent stone fruits and tropicals right up front, peach, apricot, mango, and wild berry notes too. The wet crust is aromatic and sweet. Cooked fruit and berry notes lead to wisps of peach cobbler, and an amazing perfumed floral fruit note that comes off a little like freesia flowers in the steam. This cup has plump berry flavors in light and medium roasts that are delicious, with a ripe berry/floral quality that adds a delicate aspect to the brewed coffee. Cranberry notes never left the front of my mind when drinking this coffee, tartly sweet, and mouth refreshing. This coffee has a lot to offer as it cools, accent notes of blueberry, orange, mango, fruit salad...and more! I suppose there's a rustic side too, being a natural and all, but the fruits are surprisingly clean, with a bit of brightness that helps convey structure to some of the wilder flavors. Berry notes don't let up at Full City either. My Full City roast was 32F beyond the start of 1st Crack. It brought out a hefty cocoa flavor that led right into notes of dried blueberry, and plum, and still wielded some perceived acidity. A note on espresso: If you're a fan of fruity espresso, Buliye is incredible again this year! (think chocolate and blueberry syrups swirled together, with inky texture, and a bright shot across the brow up front!). That said, I'm withholding the espresso recommendation from the coffee ""Specs"" tab and short description because I think it is too wild for the average espresso drinker.",https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-dry-process-guji-hambela-buliye-7998.html,8.75,2025-01-27 00:18:58.423401-07,sweet_maria,true,,

It's part of a larger farm, owned and operated by Joiner Alvarado and his family. When Joiner got his start in coffee, he would sell his harvest to other mills in nearby towns. After saving enough money he decided to step out on his own and build his own micro mill called ""Joicafe"". Joiners farm is 40 hectares overall, spans an altitude range of 1650 to 2000 meters above sea level, and is planted in Caturra, and Catuaí. This lot is what's called ""White Honey"" in Costa Rica, which is really their equivalent of fully washed coffee, though there is no fermentation stage. The coffee is pulped using a mechanical demucilager calibrated to remove most of the outer fruit and sticky mucilage in one fell swoop. The coffee seeds are then moved to patios where it drives over the course of 1-2 weeks. Even though it isn't a full honey process coffee, it still produced more chaff than your typical wet process lot. It's just something to keep an eye on between batches, vaccuuming as needed.",Farm Gate,"Grinding a City roast released a sweet scent of spiced sugars, accented by pungent molasses, with fruited hints coming up from behind things, like sticky dates, and fig butter with cinnamon. The wet aroma had some rustic date sugar notes, along with raisin. The cup is right in line with the smells. A well-balanced bittering flavor is accented by spiced fruits, like apple pie filling made with cinnamon and brown sugar. As the coffee cooled there was a pleasantly acetic quality that brought a complex wine note to the profile, propped up by juicy mouthfeel. Full City roasts brewed up a thick-bodied, chocolaty coffee with a lot less fruit. I preferred my City/City+ roasts for brewed coffee, and darker roasts of Full City, or beyond, for espresso.

We put this blend together after cupping several samples from the region, the goal being to separate out any coffees that hit our quality target. Each individual lot was on the small side to bring in on their own, however together, they totaled 31 bags. This year the exporter we work with opened their own buying warehouse in town in order to have a more direct hand in how the coffee and payments are being managed. It was perhaps the most competitive year for buying in Colombia that we've seen in over a decade, with the local price soaring to nearly double what it was last year. When the margin between base price and microlot price narrows to such a degree, farmers have less incentive to separate out their best coffee for a meager second payment. So this year we paid higher prices than ever in order to maintain those longstanding relationships and get the coffees we want. Farms are typically planted in Caturra and Variedad Colombia (F4 and F6 types), grown at altitudes between 1700 and 2100 meters.",Farm Gate,"At City roast level, the dry fragrance is enmeshed with a scent of caramelized sugar, honey and almond. With a shade more roast development the 'caramelized' scent is even more compelling, especially in the wetted grounds where the bittersweetness is accented by notes of caramel crumble, and dark toffee. Light roasts offer approachable flavors that are well defined, and carry some brightness too. There's depth to the sweetness in the cup. Flavor profiles of raw cane sugar are aromatic like panela/piloncillo, with some buttery caramel. Notes of walnut and cocoa powder in the finish lead to some light bittering on the tongue. The acidity level is moderate, with tea-like aspects leading into lightly aromatic notes of cinnamon stick, and black currant tea.

If you travel west on the road from the capital Sana'a, toward Hodeidah on the Red Sea, you will pass quite close to Haraz, as I did when traveling to Yemen a several years back. I visited an amazing zone within Haraz with towering, ancient stone villages, like castles precariously perched atop steep precipice. It was incredibly dramatic. All the coffee here is grown on terraces, since little land exists that is flat, except for the lowland deserts. The coffee is hauled up remarkably steep slopes, carried in small amounts, most often by donkey. This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the operations, she has worked to implement quality-focused practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. Roughly 140 farmers are contributing to this regional blend, and the altitude of the farms hover around 2200 meters above sea level.

The wet aroma is complex with layers of sweet-to-savory notes, like palm sugar, toasted barley tea, and sweet squash. Bani Haraz should be roasted to City+ minimum to develop sweetness, and Full City is a good starting point for those looking to bring out a low toned profile. Middle roast levels build out a bittersweet chocolate core that expands to include creamy Brazil nut, earthy cacao, leaving room for top notes of fruit, and an aromatic sweet note that brought to mind caramels made with goat milk. The cooling coffee produces flavor aspects of cocoa-dusted pumpkin seeds, chocolate malted grains, and dried apricot and date. I picked up on a slight acidic impression at City+ roast level too, with rhubarb, and a tobacco hint. My darkest Full City+ roast pushed bittersweet cocoa roast tones to their limit, with wisps of sweet smoke (like applewood chips), and hint of anise. This viscous coffee also makes an intense shot of espresso on its own, as well as a bittersweet/body ingredient for espresso blending.

We favor coffees that work well as brewed coffee and espresso, and that show well at a variety of roast levels, so that we get a decaf that hits those same marks. Swiss Water decaf in Vancouver BC are a key ingredient in that last part. Their patented chemical-free water process method is one of the gentler methods out there, and we've found that the coffees we have processed by Swiss come back tasting great.

The espresso has balanced bittersweet notes, thick and opaque body, almond and chocolate roast flavors, hints of spiced fruit in aroma. Full City+ and beyond.","Once there was ""Classic Italian,"" our espresso blend to set the benchmark for traditional European-style espresso. It was a blend based on quality Brazil coffees, with a touch of aromatic Central American coffee to add a grace note to the cup, and it had a small percentage of premium robusta in it for crema, mouthfeel, and to add traditional flavors found on the continent. But times change and tastes change. Espresso culture is much less Euro-centric, and for good reason. While Italy gave us espresso, the general quality of your average espresso there can be quite poor. Don't even talk about coffee in France. The big brands in Europe are largely run by multi-nationals who keep a close watch on price, and gleefully buy lower quality green coffee if they can save .01 Euro. The privates follow suit, in order to compete. Of course, there are many exceptions, but the darker roast styles, well into 2nd crack, to cover up the use of low quality green coffee ... well, that is NOT something to emulate. For Sweet Maria's, espresso has never been our ""dumping ground"" for coffees we can't sell, old lots, or ones with mild defect. It's been a program where we have dedicated time, focus in cupping, and roast testing. With this in mind, we want to start over again, and offer New Classic, a somewhat silly name, an oxymoron, and overused ... but it says what I want it to say: Here is the new benchmark espresso with sweet-bittersweet balance, body, crema, and finesse, the core definition of the espresso beverage, and defines it in the established West Coast espresso style (clean, bright notes) without the burden of European espresso conventions. In other words, no robusta! Oh, and No obsessive interest in crema! (You can produce buckets of crema in espresso and still have a very mediocre-tasting cup. What ... do you make espresso just to look at the beautiful crema? No dummy, you make it to drink it!). New Classic generally involves Brazil as one of the base ingredients, with washed Centrals and South American coffees bolstering sweetness, and of course, chocolate roast tone. Blend ingredients will change with what's in season, but we always shoot for flavor continuity.","Farm Gate, Sweet Maria's Blends","While this blend is designed primarily for a Full City roast, stopping the roast before 2nd crack, it also works well with a darker roast treatment. It does not have the extreme brightness that have been the trademark of some of our Espresso Workshop blends; it is a bit more restrained in it's overall demeanor. The cup has a balance between sweet and bittersweet flavors, moderate bright accent, soft traces of fruit, body and depth. The Full City roasts have a very sweet aromatic side, lightly fruited with plum and a hint of spice (cinnamon, cardamom). Darker roasts tend toward chocolate laced with dark fruit tones, in both aroma and cup flavor. Both have a firm, opaque body, which only helps strengthen the creamy dark chocolate flavors, along with toasted almond roast notes as the espresso cools. In the aftertaste, dark fruits accent a very sweet finish for espresso. There are whole spice hints, like anise, too, which with the fruited accent made me think of fruit-flavored licorice. Of course, results vary with how the espresso machine and grinder are set up. We use 8.5 bars of pressure at the head, with 202-205 degrees water temperature (measured at the head) to start, dropping to about 198.

Between these three, we find an espresso on the rustic and exotic side, some fruit-forward character and earth-toned bittersweetness in full effect. It's great as espresso in the Full City+ to Vienna roast territory, and the mix of dry process coffees handle well in the roaster, regardless of the difference in density when sticking to the recommended roast range. Full City roasts may show some variance, and I recommend taking your roasts closer to Full City+ development which will help afford roast evenness. Slowly ramping up the heat will also help in this effort if your roaster has manual heat control. For those without (like a popper for example), try slowing your roast by slightly overloading the chamber and I wouldn't stop the roast development until you're on the heels of 2nd snaps. (I ""overload"" the roast chamber by first turning the popper on, then adding coffee until just after it stops moving - it should only take a few seconds to get the coffee moving again).

Dense, thick body adds to the sense of an almost chewy cup character! Full City+ roasts show a bittersweetness of smoky cacao nib and mesquite notes, offset by sweet molasses and chocolate syrup, that all do well to ground the wilder cup characteristics. Espresso is where this blend really shows best, with an underpinning of rich chocolate layers, high % cacao up front, roasted nibs in the middle, and an unsweetened baking type chocolate flavor that lingers long into the finish. Dried fruit notes are played up in the cup, due in large part to the Ethiopian component that finds footing in the flavor profile. Notes of slab apricot and plum offer fruited counterpoints to the bold, bittersweet low tones, and are distilled down to an opaque fruited chocolate flavor. The top notes in the finish are leathery, herbal, fruited, earthy, and of course, bittersweet. The mouthfeel of Full City+ and Vienna roasts as espresso is velvety, and offers a delicious espresso base for milk drinks. Moka Kadir is made up of all dry process ingredients, so you can expect quite a bit of chaff during roasting.

I can honestly say, it's a resounding success and is hard to pinpoint as 'decaf' coffee at all! (It's worth noting that the high score should be taken in context of other decafs). This is an incredibly forgiving blend where bittersweetness is a prominent feature at a very wide range of roast levels.","Farm Gate, Decaf, Sweet Maria's Blends","This blend of Ethiopian and Indonesian decafs is versatile, and very sweet at many roast levels. We tested City+ and Full City for this review and found the flavors held enticing top notes suspended in a very bittersweet flavor base. The more developed roast presented a lot darker in both flavor and color, and had a more pungent flavors of dark cocoa and burnt sugars, without pulling out any ashy notes. The coffee lets off an interesting fragrance and aromatic profile for decaf, from blackstrap molasses, to fruit leather sweetness, to doughy bread notes. City+ roasts make an excellent cup, and I don't think I would know it's decaf if no one told me! There is chocolate bittersweetness meshed with hints of berry, and prune, that add a nice juicy aspect. The earthy flavors from the Indonesian coffees add to the depth of flavor, but were overall fairly restrained in both of my roasts. In terms of acidity, it's not a bright cup, but not flat either. The subtle acidic impression that graced my City+ roast was a welcome aspect, especially for decaf!  My darker roast amplified opaque bittering cocoa notes, and brought out some pungent burnt sugars.

Best with resting 48-72 hours. Full City to Full City+.","Our latest version of ""Ethiopiques 2.0"" is a blend of wet and dry processed Ethiopias that melds the body and fruit tones of these particular ingredients, with the bittersweet chocolatey flavors that come with darker roasting. For those who appreciate both, it's a match made in heaven, and I think you'll find the dark-toned fruits to be quite complimentary to the moderate level of cocoa roast flavors that comes with Full City to Full City+ roasts. The current blend (August 2023) is 1/3 wet process Ethiopia, which brought a slight floral aroma to the chocolatey low tones and fruits that find equal footing. That said, the wet process ingredient was chosen based on body and sweetness more than anything else. Full City is a good starting point, or roughly 30F post 1st Crack if your roaster has a thermocouple. You also achieve a fairly uniform roast coloring at this roast level, but being mostly dry process coffees, expect some variation. Full City+ roasts will tone down the fruit quite a bit, and is where I think this Ethiopian blend works for milk drinks. But at Full City, the fruits are a little too wild for a cappuccino or latte in my opinion.","Farm Gate, Sweet Maria's Blends","Version 2.0 was blended with espresso in mind, and what a lovely espresso it makes. (After all, it is a blend of Ethiopian coffees!) I try not to judge espresso by how it looks, but I felt fairly certain this year's version was bound to be a knockout before taking my first sip. Watching the velvety textured liquor fold into itself when pulling a shot, I found myself transfixed by the visual parallels to pouring chocolate syrup! For espresso, I'm sticking with Full City to Full City+ roast levels as the recommended range for this blend, the outer edge allowing for just a few 2nd snaps. Anything lighter than this and you wind up with shockingly bright acidity. This might suit some, but I found it to be far too puckering given the wet process component that's been added in (currently 1/3 washed, 2/3 natural). Right around Full City (around 30F post 1st C) is where I find a nice mixture of bittersweetness and fruit paired in the shot, berry and softer stone fruit notes, and some tangy fruit flavors as well. There's even a hint of florals at this roast level that is mostly lost when taken to 2nd Crack. This makes an incredibly creamy-textured shot, with a thick layer of brown-speckled, golden crema crowning the liquid. But flavor's what's important, and 2.0 is so different than any other blend we have. Fruit flavors are experienced through a bittersweet lens, dark fruit notes are jammy and sweet, rolled into robust bittersweet flavors that have a lasting impact on the finish Stepping out a little farther on the flavor branch, I pick up on notes of dried blueberry covered in dark chocolate, cherry liqueur, raspberry laced chocolate truffles, and creamy bittersweet ganache. Full City+ (FC+) flattens out the acidity, but berry notes still manage to leave an impression amidst bittering roast tones that bring out more of a roasted cacao nib bittering quality. I recommend letting your roast rest for at least 24 hours to off-gas, but this blend might find it's peak closer to 48-72 hours post-roast.",https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-maria-s-ethiopiques-version-2-0-6113.html,8.45,2025-01-20 08:45:18,sweet_maria,true,,

Many of the farms in this area are planted in older Typica types and benefit from the high slopes, situated between 1400 - 1500 meters above sea level.

This is the typical process method in Sumatra and involves removing the parchment layer while the coffee is still wet, exposing it to the elements well before the coffee is stable.

Lintong coffees are from Sumatra, the island that is politically and geographically part of Indonesia. Lintong Nihota is the town that has become synonymous with the entire southern part of Lake Toba area. Lake Toba defines the landscape of the area, the largest volcanic crater lake in the world, and the result of the largest volcanic event on earth in the last 25 million years! It is huge, and the coffees from the north and eastern shores are quite different from the Lintong coffees. Lintong coffees are farmed by the Batak peoples that are the indigenous tribe that works the coffee in this area. This coffee is part of a somewhat unlikely joint venture between a Costa Rican farmer and an Indonesian coffee exporter. Together, they see to it that the coffee is carefully selected and separated by quality, then double hand-picked during the milling process. This coffee works at a wide range of roasts, with bittersweetness and the complex forest and herbal notes of the Lintong terroir. It might go against common sense, but I find Sumatra's like this more complex in the lighter roasts than in the usual darker roasts they receive (no lighter than City+). The main reason is that many commercial roasters use color and surface texture as indicators of roast level. They roast coffee until the bean looks attractive. With a Sumatra like this, you will mostly likely hit 2nd crack at the point where the surface texture and variegated bean color evens out, and (I think) you may have gone too far at that point. This is a Sumatran coffee, meaning you should expect damage like insect holes, broken beans, and more. That said, this is much cleaner prep than your average Gr.1 Mandheling, which is not only visually noticeable, but has a positive impact on cup quality too.",,"Mutu Batak is a potent smelling coffee, with rustic-tinged sweetness from front to back. The dry grounds give off sweet date sugar notes, accented by hints of earthy spices, and pipe tobacco.

City+ and Full City roasts show plenty of earthy appeal in the cup, with molasses and sorghum-like sweetness, contemplative foresty flavors, and indications of peat/scotch and aromatic woody incense. Bittering low tones build momentum with deeper roast development, and is especially the case in Full City/Full City+ roasts, which I fully endorse. Some of that earth-toned sweetness is still very much present with 2nd snaps, adding some interest to the opaque roast tones, and accents of licorice root, and charred cedar come through in the aftertaste.

Farms in these regions tend to span an altitude range from about 1300 to 1600 meters and are planted in older, long berry types (you'll see the long, canoe shaped beans) Abysinnia, Ateng and Tim Tim. In the scheme of things, Aulia's operation is quite small. He usually buys a few bags at a time, and then processes coffee with family at home. With small scale comes the capability for a high level of quality management, which he puts into all of the different process technics he employs. This coffee is an anaerobic-wet hulled coffee, a hybrid of sorts that constructs incredibly complex cup flavors. The first step of this hybrid coffee process involves storing the whole cherry in a sealed environment, which is where the name ""anaerobic"" comes from (though not entirely correct, since there is still oxygen inside the barrels or bags used). While the cherry is fermenting in this closed system, the CO2 that is created during the process builds into a high pressure environment, that supposedly allows for a more controlled fermentation process. One thing's for sure, most of the anaerobic fermented coffees we've tried skew toward outlier fruit flavors, winey in character, and with lower acidity. This seems to be the case here, though tempered by the wet hulled/giling basah step that follows. The cherry and fruit are peeled straight from the fermentation tanks, and then dried the rest of the way on raised beds. This step of the process is what constructs the earth-toned flavors we tend to associate with Sumatra, and certainly what popularized the coffees from this region. But here we have a unique hybrid process that brings out the best of both worlds. A cup of fruit and foresty flavors, big body, low toned, and complex through and through.",Farm Gate,"For an anaerobic coffee, I found this lot from Aulia to be on the milder side of the fruit spectrum in that the flavors never tasted over the top, or wild with ferment.

The dry fragrance had a sweet scent of palm sugar and baked fruit, fresh herbs, and a bit of roast intensity in my darker roast.

But other than winning this competition, the cooperative struggled during this time, taking out a bank loan to build a new wet mill that low harvests and insufficient mill capacity made it difficult to repay. A private exporter stepped in to help out, purchasing the wet mill, but leaving the farmer cooperative structure intact. This has benefited the coop in that they are absolved of their loan debt, have a direct connection with the specialty market through a well-established export partner, and retain a supply chain that is completely transparent. The wet mill recently underwent renovation, expanding their milling infrastructure in order to increase their production capabilities.

The coffee is processed by the farmers using small machinery to remove the outer cherry skins, then fermenting for around 2 days before moving to indoor drying rooms for around 3 weeks (often referred to as ""solar dryers"", and similar to how coffee is dried in Colombia). Once dried to roughly 10-11% moisture content, the coffee is moved to the dry mill of an exporter we work with in Peru, who then remove the parchment layer and grade the coffee.

Maracturra can be tricky to roast due to the enormous bean size requiring a little extra time to develop the inside of the bean. Los Medios is a slightly smaller size than standard Maracaturra, but still a factor to consider when roasting.

The fruited elements find a nice supporting sweetness in the brew, a bit transparent, like simple syrup, but then shifting to less refined types in the finish (think turbinado, demerara, etc...semi-refined sugars that still have some molasses). A citrusy tang lead to flavors of pomello and orange, as well as a fragrant lemongrass note that adds a pleasantly herbaceaus hint to the profile.

While we tend to mostly buy wet process Kenyan coffees, known for clean and bright flavors, we're also drawn to fruity dry process lots like this. The cup profile showed a lot of stone fruit character, and heady spice notes, like woody Chai tea. It's quite a contrast to the other Kenya's on our site, and I recommend it to those who enjoy dry process coffees from Ethiopia (or really anyone who enjoys wilder, unrestrained flavors!). Kagunyu Factory is close to Mukurwe-ini, and was formerly part of this society until it fell apart in the '90s. Within the same Rumukia group are some other fantastic stations we have offered coffee from in the past: Kiawamururu, Gatura, and Tambaya to name a few. The altitude is 1600+ meters above sea level, and growing areas in the fertile foothills of Mt. Kenya and Aberdare ranges. Most farmer members have on average only 250 coffee tress: a ""garden"" more or less. Again, in Kenya coffee ""societies"" the farmer's plots are so small, they are measured in numbers of trees, not in area of land as they are in other coffee origins. But this means that co-ops provide micro-management of every coffee tree by the owner of the land, not by a large-scale agriculture operation like the big estates of Kiambu or Thika. The member farmers have the two preferred coffee varieties under cultivation, SL-28 and SL-34, with the vast majority of trees being SL-28.",Farm Gate,"While we tend to focus on sourcing wet process Kenyan coffees, we tasted a few dry process offers last season that we just had to have. Kagunyu was one of them. It pushed big fruit flavors in the cup that were a bit rustic, like dried fruit, with some more complex fermented notes too. The ground coffee released a scent of dried stone fruit and mango, with a creamy note of fruit smoothie. After pouring hot water on the grounds, the crust that formed at the top of our glasses had a powerful sweetness of caramelized sugars, accented by notes of berry sauce, fermented peach, and woody whole spices. At City roast level, the brewed coffee had very nice stone fruit flavors that came off like kombucha, dried apricot, and peach Italian soda with cream. There's a very pleasant acidity in the lighter roasts, also reminiscent of stone fruit. As the coffee cooled down a bit, we noted flavor profiles of spiced fruit chutney, orange marmalade, and woody Chai spices. Our darkest roast was only City+, which brought out some red fruits and berries, like fermented blackberry, and dried plum.

Good for espresso.","This wet hulled coffee is a small producer blend from farms near the mountain peak of Tilu ( peak is called ""Gunung""). Tilu has a very high altitude, and farms in the nearby villages where this coffee was collected tend to stagger between 1600 and 1800 meters above sea level. The intermediary we are doing business with works closely with local farmers in West Java, wet-processing coffee in small batches to high standards. This lot is from a man named Dani, a farmer and collector in Gambung Pangkalan. Dani buys the wet process coffee farmers in Tilu, and then brings it back to his mill in Gambung where he peels the parchment, and dries it the rest of the way. This seemingly unorthodox way of processing coffee is called the wet hulled method, or ""giling basah"" as it's called in parts of Indonesia. Wet hulled coffee is deep toned and earthy, rustic, and often produces big body and very low acidity. (It's no surprise that wet hulled coffees are often used in espresso blends). It's the traditional processing method in Sumatra, and a big part of what put Sumatran coffee on the map. Java Sunda (West Java) was the original coffee area, but you would find few trees here of late. Most Java coffee is grown in the East, where the big estates are. But farmers in Java Sunda always kept small coffee plots, although they mainly grown rice, onions, cabbage, carrots and other food crops for local markets in Bandung and Jakarta. Here amongst the Ateng and Jember coffees are some old Typica trees, the original Typica, which is quite amazing. (Java was the first destination for coffee from Yemen, with a stopover in India).

We are using this name for a blend of Indonesian coffees we sourced, reserving small quantities of each for a custom Swiss Water decaf. This lot of Nusantara includes wet hulled coffee from the islands of Timor Leste, a typical body/bittersweet blend component that comes through loud and clear in decaf! In addition, we've added a really interesting ""honey labu"" processed Sumatran coffee, a hybrid honey-wet hulled processing technic that we started seeing in Aceh a few years back. Both coffees were grown around 1500 meters above sea level. The honey labu coffees we've purchased have tasted more in line with sweet, and sometimes fruited, honey process coffees, rather than herbal, earthy wet hulled. Together, they construct a chocolate-laden, big bodied, decaf, that is best roasted in the middle, City+ to Full City+ roast range.

Its strength is body, and will make an interesting cup for fans of earthy, low acid cup, and an excellent addition to an espresso blend (we use it in Liquid Amber!). Full City+ to French.","Monsooned coffees are stored in special warehouses until the Monsoon season comes around. The sides of the structure are opened and moist monsoon winds circulate around the coffee making it swell in size and take on a mellowed but aggressive flavor. This Monsooned Malabar is sourced from several farms in Southern India. Typically, the coffee is naturally processed, then spread on the floor of the special monsooning warehouse, raked and turned around by hand to enable them to soak in moisture of the humid winds. The monsooning process takes around 12 to 16 months of duration, where in the beans swell to twice their original size and turn a pale golden color. Then they do additional rounds of hand sorting to remove any coffee that did not expand properly, and the coffee is prepared for export. This is an extremely pungent cup with a unique combination of burnt-bittering flavors, caramel finish and potent earthy aspects. It is not for those who like a ""clean"" cup, or sweet coffees! By all standard definitions, this is a defective set of cup flavors, though still quite interesting, unique, and not to mention, useful. (It's been a key component in our Liquid Amber espresso blend since the beginning!) Monsooned Malabar gets a free pass from the coffee censors because of cultural tradition, history, and the fact that (while it doesn't conform to the traditional ideas of good coffee) it is in it's own right a unique coffee flavor. It has some use in espresso blending with a preparation of longer drum roasting and resting (after roasting) of 3+ days. There are Italian espresso roasting companies that use this coffee in their ""exotic"" blend offering, along with 2-3 other non-monsooned arabicas to even out the cup and provide aroma and some sweetness. Even as a drip/infusion brew, the coffee mellows after 2 days and the cup is more balanced so resting is key to best cup results. Please see the physical appearance of the coffee in that first photo, as it can be quite a shock if you've never seen Monsoon coffee before! It's pale white, slightly 'speckled'. We do our best to find the best quality all around, and think this is one of the cleanest looking lot we've seen in a long time!",,"There's nothing quite like Indian Monsooned coffee.

In fact, it's a big part of the success of one of our most popular blends, Sweet Maria's Liquid Amber Espresso Blend. On its own, the cup is a bit of a shock to the palate. Much more bitter than sweet, caramel notes are merely hints brooding low tones. At Full City+ to French (FC+ should be the minimum), the cup has pungent bitter cocoa, unsweetened Baker's chocolate, spice, earthy accent notes, and a smokey aroma. The cup cools to interesting flavor accents like roasted corn, and earthy raw and roasted cacao nibs. Monsoon is for blending in our opinion, adding body and bittering low tones. It does not conform to standard cupping evaluation, and we added in a ""cupper's correction"" score of 8 to bump it up to 85 points as a way of expressing how we think this lot compares to other Monsoon coffees we've tried. It's an exotic flavor profile for sure, and perhaps an acquired taste.

Once the coffee is imported, we break off a few bags from different selections so that we can have a delicious decaf blend as a compliment to our regular offerings as well. This decaf was processed by Swiss Water in Vancouver, BC, known the world over for their chemical-free, water-based decaf process technic that is gentle on the coffee and retains some of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma. Send off delicious regular coffee, receive a delicious decaf in return! It's important to keep in mind that all decaf processes slightly degrade the coffee's physical structure, which has an impact on roast dynamics. If you're able to control your heat input, I recommend applying heat slowly up until about 20F before 1st Crack, then pulling back some to avoid violent fracturing. On our Probat P12, that means slowly walking the gas up to 75%, and then dropping down to 25% (maybe less) well before I hear the first 'pops'. If you're using a popper, you might try increasing batch size to slow things down a bit. I should also note that you'll likely see surface oils no matter light or dark, also a bi-product of the structure being broken down to some degree.",Farm Gate,"The dry fragrance presented deep cocoa notes and a pleasantly mild sweetness, chocolate covered almond, shortbread cookie, and a lot of bittersweet dimension. The wet aroma of my City+ and Full City roasts smelled right in-line with a medium-roasted, non-decaf Guatemalan coffee; balanced roast notes, bittersweet cocoa, and a hint of green herb that added some interest. Our brews were well-balanced and delicious, with brawny bittering cocoa that is offset by ample sweetness of raw sugars, and a nice acidic sparkle that's not too imposing but gives the cup some structure. The cooling cup yielded muted fruit tones that brought a juicy quality to lighter roasts, whereas Full City roasts harnessed this coffee's bittersweet side.

The cup has a well developed sweetness too at all roast levels we tried, with flavor profiles of honey, and raw sugar. Fruited top notes brought elements of blackberry tea, and pressed apple cider. Body is fairly juicy, a characteristic that is easily expounded on with more roast development. I found this coffee to have a sturdy core of sweet and bittering tones at Full City roast. Brewing light roasts as pour over yielded excellent results for pulling out the acidity and fruited sweetness, and I'm sure the Full City roast will make a delicious full immersion brew, like French Press, where body and bittersweetness will be the stars of the show.

Grinding a light roast released notes of fragrant raw sugars with understated hints of fruit. The wet aroma had powerful brown sugar notes, like chocolate malted grains, with a spritz of citrus. I brewed this a few different ways, and settled on my V60 pour over brewer as an effective method to highlight this coffee's 'bright' side. The sweetness is fairly complex at City roast level, pristinely clean, and opens up to a spiced raisin note, like holiday spice cookie. Bright fruits come through without imposing on core sweet flavors, with accents of tangy golden plum, and some bittering fruit skins and black tea. Acidity was a highlight of the light roasted coffee, and doesn't impact Full City roasts in the same way.

Boqueroncito starts at 1,400 meters above sea level and tops out at just under 1,550 meters. While that's not screaming high altitude for Guatemala, coffee is only planted up to about 1750 meters due to the colder climate here, which slows down the rate of cherry maturation, and aids seed density.

The name is in honor of his grandmother, Rosemarie. It's located on a high ridge where you drive in to the farm at nearly 1900 meters above sea level, then descend down to the mill at around 1600 meters. When Alejandro Rosales bought the farm in 1963, the only way to get there was by foot, or horseback. It's not that easy of a trek by road, either. The farm is quite steep, typical for the high ridges of the Sierra Los Cuchumatanes mountains. These days Alejandro's son, Fredy, plays an outsized role at Finca Rosma, and has been our connection to the farm since we started buying it more than a decade ago (it's worth noting that Fredy is also the linchpin in our Proyecto Xinabajul buying project in Huehue).

There are also red and yellow varieties. They mainly produce wet-process coffee at Rosma using traditional fermentation methods, but they also produce smaller amounts of dry process coffees too in small batches (aka ""naturals""). Whereas the wet process method involves removing the cherry before drying, the dry process method keeps the whole coffee fruit intact. It takes a lot longer to dry naturals, upwards of 3 weeks at Rosma, and the cherries ferment durig this time. While not always true, the dry process method is known for producing fruitier flavors, and certainly the case with this lot of Rosma. We found it to be quite a bodied coffee too, giving the wilder fruit and berry flavors some staying power in the finish.",Farm Gate,"Our first of two lots from longtime partner producer, Finca Rosma, is a wild and woolly dry process coffee that promises big fruits, and winey accents.

Pouring hot water on the ground coffee brings out potent fruits and berry notes, with syrupy sweet undertones, and wine-like fermented hints that permeate from the saturated grounds. One thing I really enjoyed about this dry process lot was that it has substantial bittersweetness behind the wild fruits, which gives you a lot of leeway to play with roast development if you want more of a bittersweet, fruited cup, rather than the other way around.

Good for espresso.","We just got this delicious Ethiopian decaf back from being processed at Swiss Water in Vancouver, Canada, and are amazed by how it's tasting! It helps that it's made up from coffees that we loved before being decaffeinated, and consisted of 2/3 dry process, 1/3 wet process. Including fruited dry process coffees in the mix has been a key ingredient of most of our Ethiopian decaf recipes, and a big part of why they come back tasting so nice. It's no secret that all decaffeination processes are hard on the coffee, and tend to flatten out some of the more nuanced cup flavors. But with fruit-forward dry process coffees, the process merely softens some of those heavy-handed flavors. This is one of the reasons we love working with Swiss; it allows us to send high quality coffee from our own stocks, and affords us a level of control where we can customize blends to our own taste. This lot is mostly made up of coffees from Ethiopia's Western Jimma region. The bulk of it is split between two larger scale farms run by Dehab Mesfin, near the Bonga forest in Kafa, and Senna Katta Mountain farm, in Limu's Boter forest reserve. Swiss Water Decaf decaf use their patented chemical-free, water-decaffeination process to remove 99.9% of the coffee's caffeine content. The technique is gentle on the coffee's organic structure, leaving much of the aromatic compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. Read more about the Swiss Water technique here.","Farm Gate, Decaf","When this latest Ethiopian decaf was returned to us after being processed, we were pretty floored by the cup quality. Tasting it alongside the rest of our decaf arrivals (which are all very nice, btw!) the cup flavors tasted dramatically different; complex, fruited, aromatic, and undeniably Ethiopian! Context plays a large role in this perception, so I don't want to overpromise here. But as far as decafs go, the aromatic qualities make it stand out from the pack, and will likely fly under the radar as being decaf at all. The dry fragrance gives off dried fruit, like raisin and prune, with aromatic sugars and berries. The wet aroma had more intense fruited characteristics that skewed to the 'winey' side, accented by dark spice notes. Mirabawi Buna is a very sweet brewed coffee, and origin flavors become easier to pinpoint the longer you sip it.

It's also a very nice option to use as 1:1 Moka Java blend in conjunction with our current Indonesia ""Nusantara"" decaf from Swiss.

He is the older brother to Esmael Hassan, who you may remember as the producer of another Guji coffee we've also carried, Kayon Mountain. ""Dabaye"" is the name of the kebele where this Hambela station is located (a town, more or less). We were lucky enough to be hosted at this station on our December 2018 visit, camping out in a pair of military tents replete with cots, overlooking the couple hundred drying tables below us. Kedir is an incredibly proficient and capable engineer as well as coffee farmer, and built the entire Hambela station in one season. You wouldn't know this, as it's visually apparent everything was built with high processing standards, and with efficiency in mind. Of course he did not complete Hambela on his own, and thanks to his long standing connection with the the people in this area, he had much needed community support. Hambela sits at 1816 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown as high as 2100 meters. They mostly buy coffee from farmers in the surrounding kebeles of Buliye, Wamena, Borticha, Dari Rogicha and Dabaye, of course.",Farm Gate,"Delicious and delicate, this wet-processed lot from Hambela Dabaye packs impressive sweetness, and blossoms with Guji floral cup characteristics. The dry fragrance smelled of tea-like and floral accents, with notes of white frosting, and peach. A more intense sweetness emerges from the wetted grounds, and running my spoon through the coffee crust released a potent mix of partially raw sugars, fresh flowers, and a crystalized ginger. In the cup, City roasts produce a potent floral aroma propped up by resolute sweetness of cane sugar, and accent of white honey. As the coffee cools down some, I pick up on more fruited flavors like lemonade, fresh mango, and a strawberry Starburst candy note. It's really a special coffee, lively and bright flavors are refreshing, and the complex aromatics of jasmine put it up there with some of our top washed Guji's this season. So much of the coffee character can be described as light and delicate, and you should give it a light treatment in the roaster too. Pulling 1 minute and 30 seconds after the start of 1st Crack is not too soon! The coffee coloring might look slightly uneven, with some chaff still intact to the seed.

Standout espresso option too, viscous body, and a flavor profile of chocolate-covered plum. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.","Senna Katta Mountain  farm is located in the Boter forest preserve, Limu Kossa, Jimma. It's actually the only coffee farm in this remote forest area, and the small clearing made for their processing site is pretty easy to spot on an areal map amidst the surrounding sea of green! This isn't a clear cut coffee farm, but rather, part of a government land grant where plots in agro forest areas were given away to farmers who could be good stewards to the land by maintaining the natural forest habitat. Senna Katta Mountain is owned by wife and husband Yodit, and Solomon. They are both pharmacists who met when opening a clinic in Limu Kossa sometime ago. Yodit's father was an agronomist in Jimma, working for the government, and it was their dream to build a farm in the area. With his help as their advisor, they did just that, stepping in as owners after the original owner was unable to keep up with the land improvements that were required. Senna Katta Mountain is 130 hectares in size, though only 110 hectares are under production. It's considered semi-forest coffee since it's not wild coffee, but still grows beneath the preserved forest canopy overhead. This is a very high elevation zone, the mill at 2300 meters with coffee growing even a little higher. Because of this, the coffee comes a bit later than most other areas we buy from.",Farm Gate,"Limu coffees can be quite different than those from Yirga Cheffe and Guji, and the dry process method adds a layer of unique fruits, too. The dry fragrance has fruit pastry-like sweetness, with accents cinnamon roll and raisin, stone fruit Danish, and molasses. The wet aroma brings out a really nice cooked sugar sweetness, and more defined notes of dried papaya, with honey granola. The fruits seem a little muddled when the cup is piping hot, but open up to more discernible flavors as you sit with it. At City roast level, I picked up on some really nice stone fruit and aromatic honey notes. The flavors carried a rustic element of natural dehydrated fruits, like the brown apricots, and salted plum. The cup sweetness had a palm sugar note that played off earthy hints of yellow tea, and cedar (like opening a cedar chest), and the cooling cup offered a tangy flavor profile of canned peaches. Dark roasts showed impressive chocolate flavors and viscous, inky body, along with a winey plum note.

The farmers who deliver to the Korate mill have coffee planted in high altitude zones nearby that span a range of 1900 - 2100 meters above sea level. They only produce dry processed coffees at this site (""naturals""), and with a capacity of up to 2 shipping containers a season (roughly 80k # of green coffee). That's a lot of coffee, however, it's actually on the small side for Ethiopia! The mill has registered more than 116 small farmers in total from the villages bordering the site, most with an average farm size of 2 hectares of coffee or less. Farmers are paid a higher rate for delivering only ripe cherries, which means less hand labor at the drying beds, and ultimately, a cleaner sorted coffee. Mill workers also mitigate unripe coffee by ""floating"" the coffee cherries in water. Generally, unripe coffee floats while the ripe coffee sinks. This makes removal quite easy, and a first step in grading. The coffee is then moved to raised drying beds for around 3 to 4 weeks time, until dried to around 11% moisture content.",Farm Gate,"There are so many different flavors to be found in this stunning dry process coffee from Korate, with fruit profiles that carry vivid brightness when roasted light, and perfumed floral hints that bring a refined quality to the heavy-handed fruity notes. There's a very clean sweetness in the dry fragrance, and berry-fruit accents add depth to the profile. Notes of fragrant raw sugars, strawberry jam, and chocolate milk powder popped up in our City roast. The wet aroma smelled of chocolate-dipped berries, and a beautiful floral overlay was raised in the steam. Korate is definitely of the cleaner variety of dry process Ethiopia, and one I've really enjoyed sitting with and observing the shifting flavor profiles as it cools. The cup is moderately bright for dry process, and floral too. Flavors of tannic tea and raw sugars are accented by red berry and stone fruit, and a floral rose note brings a nice level of complexity to the aroma. The fruited accents that immediately come into play pointed to ripe strawberry, orange spice tea, and peach jelly. I'm happy to report that the fruited sweetness stands up to the deeper low tones of a dark roast, so Full City gets the green light. Dark toned cocoa flavors are impacted by hints of blackberry tea, cardamom spice, and a fragrant lime note in the nose that mingles with the sharply bittersweet aftertaste.

Goro produces mostly dry process coffee, but does do small amounts of wet process too when they have the cash flow to buy more cherries. Most of the actual coffee drying happens at auxiliary sites nearby, where they also facilitate cherry buying in surrounding villages.

The dry fragrance is peppered with berry notes, both dried and cooked, accented by hints of rustic sugars, and complex aromatic notes of spices and fresh herbs. The berry aspects really came through in the wet aroma, blackberry jam, along with saturated sweetness that reminded me of blueberry pie filling, and an enticing herbal overlay. The herbal aroma really comes through in the cup loud and clear in the cup too, especially at City roast level where the brewed coffee has a strong aroma of rue herbs, along with floral accents to more subtle effect. Light roasts have a pleasant tartness to the fruited flavor profile, which lends an acidic impression to the cup flavors, an oft missing element in dry process coffees.

It's named after the owner (green jacket, third photo), who is working with a local exporter as a vertically integrated entity. In this case, the exporter affords Tuku financing to buy cherries during the harvest season, and a link to the market. The processing site sits at 2125 meters above sea level, and some of the farms they buy from are even higher elevation. The dry process method is the oldest way of processing whole coffee cherries down to the green seeds we roast, and is a big part of why coffees like Tuku taste so fruity. It takes a lot longer to dry whole coffee cherries down to the standard of 10-11% moisture, and during that time a fermentation occurs within. Not only are dry process coffees often fruit-forward, they also produce a lot more chaff than fully washed (""wet process""). Just be aware of it and be sure to vacuum your roaster between batches, especially for those with open heating elements, like a Behmor. Speaking of which, we're seeing some pretty small beans in this lot, thankfully not so small that you need to worry about roasting in your Behmor.

The coffee has to be spread out to a layer depth of only a few centimeters, no more, in order to allow air flow. The coffee is turned hourly, or even more frequently, in order to facilitate even drying and keep the coffee from molding. It's not difficult, but requires constant attention.

City to Full City. Good for espresso.","We've chosen to name this coffee, ""Nya-Nye"", due to the fact that it's a blend of coffee from Nyamasheke, Rwanda, and Nyeri, Kenya. In fact. 2/3 of this blend is Kenyan AB coffee, which is a big part of this coffee's interesting bright side. Rwandan coffee is no slouch in the acidity department either, but its Kenya that's known for high-toned flavors, and helps bring very appealing citrus flavors to this unique tasting decaf. All of the coffees that went into this blend were complex in their own way, and sweeter-than-average, which in our experience makes them great candidates for decaffeination. This lot was decaffeinated at the Swiss Water plant in Vancouver, Canada, who use only water to remove 99.9% of the caffeine content from coffee. The process is thought to be more gentle than some others that use chemical solvents, and we definitely see a difference in the cup flavors. Roasting decaf can be a little tricky since the color of the beans are already a shade of brown. It's also the case that the beans suffer some degradation from the decaffeination process and so oils tend to rise to the surface more easily, even when roasted to City+. For home roasters, if your roaster has manual heat control, try taking a slower approach to avoid a violent 1st crack and so that it doesn't get away from you. In a popper you can try overloading the batch size which should help to slow roast progression down some. Learn more about the Swiss Water Decaf method here.","Farm Gate, Decaf","The dry fragrance at City roast level has a chocolate wafer cookie smell and molasses, with hints of spice and stewed fruits. The wet aroma brought out a creamy-sweet honey butter note, with caramelized sugars, sweet breads like cinnamon roll, and raisin. The hot coffee has the bittering and sweet aspects of burned caramel up front, with roast tone close behind. The acidity level is pretty remarkable for decaf coffee too, especially when roasted light. But you can also roll off the high tones by roasting to Full City too, simultaneously dialing up body and bittersweet roast flavors. My City roast had flashes of vibrant citrus that brought to mind lemon squares. There's a juicy quality too, pulling out some of the fruited hints, like apple, peach, and berry. Dark cocoa notes are out in full force at Full City, with an unrefined molasses note underneath, and a chocolate stout flavor in the finish that has staying power. Full City roasts will work really well as a bittersweet, and chocolatey espresso.

Maria Elena's farm, Finca La Salaca, sits at 1750 meters above sea level on the lush mountainous slopes of Zarcero in Costa Rica's famed West Valley growing region. The Pacific is the major influence in the West Valley with sprawling views of Naranjo and Alajuela readily available across it. Finca Salaca is planted with a lot of Villalobos varietal, some Villa Sarchi, and Caturra mixed in. This is a separation of Villa Sarchi, which is a natural mutation of Bourbon known for shorter stature (""dwarf""), high yield, and great cup potential - especially when grown at high altitudes. The Monte Brisas mill is incredibly clean and well cared for, and feels a bit like a museum with all of its meticulously maintained older machinery! The coffee is mechanically washed on a Desacafe machine and sun dried on raised beds adjacent to the wet mill. Leaving that fruit mucilage intact instead of washing it away is the hallmark of honey process coffee. This lot, however, is what some call ""semi-washed"", or ""white honey"", which is the Costa Rican equivalent of a fully washed coffee. The demucilager machine is calibrated to remove as much fruit as possible. Then the coffee is soaked for a short period to help wash away some of the remaining fruit. Without fermentation, there is still a very thin layer of fruit intact. This means the coffee looks a little darker when roasting it, and a much higher instance of chaff than the typical fully washed/fermented coffee.",Farm Gate,"This lot from Monte Brisas is a balanced coffee with a nuanced side that adds a bit of interest to the cup profile (especially the light roasts). A scent of caramelized sugar and toasted marshmallow melded well together in the dry fragrance of the City roast, with accents of butter rum Life Savers, and cocoa. The crust on the light roast demonstrated more of the butterscotch type sweetness, flanked by hints of citrus, brown sugar, and a raisin note in the steam. The cup has a very clean profile with raw sugar notes at the core, accented by milder fruit hints, lightly spiced, and brisk acidity. Hints of fresh apple and lemon tea add to this coffee's vibrant side, and lead to a mouth-cleansing finish.

This particular lot is mechanically washed, which means that in stead of using fermentation to remove the sticky fruit after depulping, they strip both cherry and fruit away using a mechanical demucilager equipment. It's the same machinery used to produce honeys. A simple adjustment to the demucilager affects how much fruit is left intact after depulping. The more fruit, the wilder the cup flavors. This lot was processed as what's referred to as ""White Honey"" in Costa Rica, which just means they remove as much fruit as possible without scoring the seed. The resulting cup is a close approximation to ""fully washed"", fermented coffee, with clean cup flavors, and acidity that sparkles. There is a bit more chaff produced during roasting than a fully washed coffee, but nowhere near the amount of dry process or honey process coffees. The coffee also presents darker during the roasting process, which is something to pay attention to when judging roast level, as they are often slightly lighter than they appear. The city of San Marcos is in the Talamanca Sierra highlands, with peaks reaching as high as 3000 meters. It's an ideal micro-region and climate for growing coffee with rich volcanic soil, great altitude, and is shaded from the hot afternoon suns by mountain peaks.

If the roasted coffee hadn't been on the cupping table, I would've guessed it was Pacamara. Finding out it has Villalobos variety in it helped make sense of the fragrant aroma. Villalobos is a natural dwarf mutation of Typica found mostly in Costa Rica, that often expresses interesting flavors and pronounced acidity. The ""El Coyote"" farm is run by Horacio and Alejandro Solis, in Tarrazu's Talamanca Sierra highland region, where they operate the La Casona micro mill. Their farm is broken into 40 different lots, each with distinct demarcation, and a different mix of varieties. El Coyote is planted in Villalobos and Catuaí, and stretches upward of 2000 meters above sea level. This is a red honey process coffee, which means that after the outer cherry is pulped, the sticky fruit mucilage is left intact to the coffee seeds during the drying phase. It turns a reddish color when dry, which is how it got the name ""red honey"". We often find that red honey coffees have fruitier flavors than washed, and while I wouldn't call this coffee ""fruity"", it certainly offers clean fruit accents. Honey process coffees tend to present darker when roasting, and also produce a lot of chaff. It's not hard to roast, per se, but you should pay closer attention to time and the audible snaps, rather than physical coloring for judging roast degree.",Farm Gate,"When I initially tasted this coffee during my March visit to Costa Rica, I was impressed by the aromatic top notes. The profiles are light and delicate, with fresh herbal highlights that reminded me of some of our best examples of Pacamara, Maracaturra, and Parainema varieties. They have a lot of Villalobos planted at the farm, which helps makes sense of this. Light roasts have an herbaceous sweetness in the ground coffee, a little floral, like chamomile flower, with interesting complexity to the sweetness, like medicinal honey. The wet aroma when pouring hot water on the grounds has an incredibly attractive smell, with sweetness reaching a floral pitch, like opening a bag light brown sugar, and accented by delicate notes of elderflower, and citrus. The sweetness has staying power in the brew, and creates a nice base tone for the the complex top notes to hang on. I get aromatic honey in the cup, with very nice herbal accent notes that impact the aromatic profile. Think chamomile tea, lemon sage, and coriander. City roasts have a crisp red apple note, with a hint of mandarin orange, that fade to some dark tea tannins in a pleasantly bittering finish. The only dark roast I tried was almost Full City+, and just before 2nd Cracks (438F). While maybe too dark for my taste, there was a pretty high level of sweetness that fed into the bittersweet roast flavors, and something about the 'roast' smokiness and sweetness brought to mind toasted coconut.

Currently under the management of Diego Guardia, the farm have decided to move away from more water intensive process methods, favoring honey and dry process instead.

Our ""Aponte"" honey process blend is made up of coffee from the broader Aponte region, however this lot is comprised of coffee from two neighboring farmers, Eduardo and Lauerano Martinez, who live in the Aponte village of 'El Páramo'. The people of Aponte are Inga decent, a pre-Colombian ethnic group related to the Incas, their native tongue being Inga Kichwa. Aponte is located in a misty páramo region around 1900 meters above sea level and the farmers in this growing region produce mainly Caturra an Variedad Colombia, the latter being a disease resistant hybrid. What's interesting about the coffee from this region is that honey processing is the standard post harvest process method. Each producer handles their own processing at home too, which can mean quite a bit of flavor variation from one neighbor to the next. The land where the coffee is grown is owned by the community, but each producer is in charge of specific plots and can sell the coffee they produce. Honey Processing is a processing method where the coffee cherry and some of the fruit is mechanically removed, leaving behind a thin layer of fruit which is then laid out on raised beds to dry. Drying can take more than 2 weeks, the prolonged exposure to the coffee fruit causing a very subtle and slow fermentation to occur, and often imparts fruit-like flavors in the coffee itself.

Aromatically speaking, the coffee produces juicy notes of red fruits, stewed plums, and underlying sweetness of blackstrap molasses. This brewed coffee has a very nice core sweetness in the cup too, suspending the fruit flavors nicely in the profile. The cup shows impressive fruit notes across the roast spectrum, like cooked berries, juicy plum and grape, along with some more rustic aspects of dried tamarind, and fermented orange. Full City roasts are syrupy and bittersweet, and still offers convincing dark berry tones in flavor and aroma. El Páramo ticks off a lot of boxes for espresso, too, with thick, creamy mouthfeel, dense chocolate flavors, and red fruits edging into the mix. Honey process coffees produce a lot more chaff than washed, which is something to be aware of when roasting.

We chose the coffees specifically for decaffeination, based on the cup profiles having some mild fruit characteristics and pronounced acidity. In our experience, those types of cup attributes will withstand some of the gentler decaffeination methods, such as this ethyl acetate (""EA""). The coffee was decaffeinated by Descafecol, in Tolima, who use sugar cane as one of their main sources for the naturally occurring chemical needed for the process (hence the nickname ""sugar cane decaf"", which is likely only one of the sources of EA). This year the exporter we work with opened their own buying warehouse in town in order to have a more direct hand in how the coffee and payments are being managed. It was perhaps the most competitive year for buying in Colombia that we've seen in over a decade, with the local price soaring to nearly double what it was last year. When the margin between base price and microlot price narrows to such a degree, farmers have less incentive to separate out their best coffee for a meager second payment. So this year we paid higher prices than ever in order to maintain those longstanding relationships and get the coffees we want - including those that went into this decaf.

Good for espresso.","Unlike wet processing, where the cherry and fruit are removed before drying, dry process coffees (""natural"") are laid out with the cherry intact through the entire drying phase. With the fruit intact, dry times increase 3 to 4 fold, taking upwards to a month depending on weather. Dry process coffees tend to be fruit-forward, sometimes even ""winey"" in a slightly fermented flavor, bodied and acidity flattened to some degree. What we have here with Kibingo is a clean example of dry process coffee with a lot of fruit character, never quite reaching the ""ferment"" flavors. Kibingo Station is a coffee cherry collection site located in Kayanza, Burundi's northern province that borders neighboring Rwanda. The washing station acts as a central delivery site for a few thousand small holder famers who occupy the 18 hills that surround Kibingo. Kibingo sits at just under 1900 meters above sea level, and many of the farmers have coffee planted much higher than this. Kibingo is named after reeds that are growing in the river running alongside the station site, planted in order to help keep the soil at the banks from eroding. They've been around since the mid 1980s, and a couple years back, took 1st place at the Burundi Cup of Excellence competition, no small feat.",Farm Gate,"The level to which Kibingo shows fruit can vary quite a bit depending on roast level. My City and City+ roasts showed more pronounced fruit tones than at Full City, with a backdrop of rustic bittersweets. Full City, however, was more of a low-toned cup, still delicious, but the bittersweetness overpowered any process flavors of fruit. The dry fragrance had cocoa-dusted dried fruits, and raisin. Pouring hot water brought out a clean sweetness of stewed fruits. The brewed coffee had flavorsome notes of cooked fruits, like dates, and plums, along with a slightly tart note that brought out subtle profiles of raspberry and citrus. Cooling off some, the coffee shows a rustic sweetness like barley malt syrup in the background, unrefined and aromatic, that opened up to dried fruit hints. My Full City roast married bittersweet cocoa powder flavors to soft dark fruit hints, and the finish was long and smokey. Acidity was on the quiet side and slight, which is a net positive if looking for a dry process coffee for espresso.

The farm is owned by Francisco Isidro Dias Pereira who has 75 hectares dedicated to coffee with a total size of 215 hectares of land. Santa Ines is located in Carmo de Minas at 1100 meters, and this lot is 100% Yellow Bourbon cultivar. Yellow Bourbon is a sub-type that has fruit which ripens to a yellow color. It originated in Brazil. It is possible that Yellow Bourbon is a natural mutation of a cross between Bourbon and a yellow-fruited Typica called ""Amarelo de Botocatu"". Bourbon coffees are named for the island in the India Ocean where French colonists grew it. It's not so different in the cup than Red Bourbon, but I have noticed higher sugar levels in the Yellow fruit, and the plant has different physical properties.",Farm Gate,"The dry fragrance has a praline nut smell, savory accents, and cocoa. The wet aroma echoes these smells, with sweetness that's a bit like peanut candies, with dark cocoa bittersweetness. City+ and Full City roasts bring out moderately bittersweet flavors in the brewed coffee, with notes of caramelized sugar, butter nut toffee, and a sweet grain flavor that comes off like carob in the aftertaste. Pulp natural processing makes for a nice mild Brazil cup, with softness you'd expect in relation to acidity. The body is thick, especially with more roast development, and dark roasts will bring intense bittersweetness and thick mouthfeel. There's a classic nutty Brazil roast tone (hazelnut in particular) turning more toward cocoa powder in the darker levels at Full City/FC+ roasts.

Prime for milk drinks. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.","Laura Junqueira is a third generation coffee coffee farmer who, along with her father, Roberto Machado (""Beto""), run the 150 hectare farm, Fazenda São José Condado. The farm has stood much longer than the Junqueira family has owned it, dating back to the mid 1800's when the first coffee was planted and the original farm house was built. The farm is located just outside of Santa Rita do Sacupaí in the Mantiqueira Region of Minas Gerais. The land at São José is actually 508 hectares, much of which is still natural forest. It requires a fairly large team to manage just the part planted in coffee, and there are 22 permanent employees year round, as well as 100 seasonal workers who join for the harvest. The farm enjoys a modest altitude of 1200 meters above sea level, and is currently planted in Mundo Novo, Acaiá, Catuaí Amarelo, Catuaí Vermelho, Arara, and Catucaí. While much of Brazil coffee farmers have turned to harvesting machinery, the Junqueira family recognizes the importance of selecting ripe cherries in order to produce top grades, and has therefore chosen to stick with selective harvesting by hand. This lot is a pulp natural process which is about as closed to a fully washed coffee as you will get in Brazil, and quite similar to a mild honey process method in Costa Rica. The coffee cherry and much of the fruit are removed with depulping machinery, and then the seed is laid to dry with fruit mucilage still intact. Pulp naturals often possess more balanced flavors than dry process coffee, less fruited, and can still be big-bodied and lower acid coffees, making them a great choice for espresso and blending.",Farm Gate,"Aromatically speaking, this lot from Laura Junqueira had an understated raw sugar sweetness at City+ roast level, malted bread, wheat puff, and bittersweet at the edges. There was a sweet nuttiness in the steam after pouring hot water on the grounds, like peanut butter cookie.

It's a pleasantly simple coffee, tied to bittersweetness, and subtle top note hints. City+ brews had accents of honey-nut, zucchini bread, sesame cookie, and a faint dried apple note.

Pleasant cup sweetness at City+ with accents of toffee peanut, almond, caramel, and bittersweet cocoa powder. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.","This coffee comes to us from two farms in the region of Sul de Minas, Mantiqueira micro region, an area that boasts over 2000 smaller coffee farms. They started off as non-decaf coffees that we liked so much, we peeled off a few pallets specifically to send off for decaffeination. All of our decafs are processed by Swiss Water Process in Canada, whose patented process uses only water to remove  99.9% of the caffeine content and leaving much of the volatile compounds intact. A bit about the farms that went into this decaf: At roughly 30-50 hectares each, the farm sizes aren't ""small"" when comparing with the small holder farms we buy from in regions like Colombia for example. But they're small for Brazil, home to massive estates with fully mechanized harvesting operations. These smaller estates still manually pick coffee as opposed to using machinery, allowing for better separation of ripe and underripe cherry. The farms are located around the Pedra Branca mountians, plantings in the 1300 meter range and planted mainly in Yellow Bourbon and Catuai. I was pleasantly surprised to hear an audible 'snap' at the first signs of fracturing, which isn't always the case with decaf. This one's not too difficult to judge roast development by sound, but sight is always a little trickier since the coffee is already degraded and dark from the decaf process. Try pulling it a little sooner than you think and adjust from there.","Farm Gate, Decaf","The dry fragrance had sweet nut tones, roasted almond shadowed by mild molasses notes, and a waxy honey comb smell.

If you're wanting the flavors of a nice Brazilian coffee without the caffeine, Duas Fazendas is it! We found that we actually preferred the flavor profile to some of our non-decafs, actually. The cup sweetness was quite nice at City+, with flavor accents of toffee peanut and almond folded into a sweet layer of caramel. There was even noticable acidic impression at this roast level which really rounded out the cup.
