227	Colombia Buesaco EA Decaf	87	March 2024 Arrival	Buesaco, Nariño, Cauca	Wet Process (Washed) then EA Decaf ("Sugarcane")	Covered Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	58	70 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Caturra, Variedad Colombia, Typica	Estate	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Caramel accents, malted grains, spiced aroma, doughy cinnamon roll, smoked chocolate, woodsy accent, and moderate acidity helps it fly under the radar as decaf. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This decaf was sourced from small producers near Buesaco town, in Colombia's Nariño Department. We chose the coffees specifically for decaffeination, based on the cup profiles having some mild fruit characteristics and pronounced acidity. In our experience, those types of cup attributes will withstand some of the gentler decaffeination methods, such as this ethyl acetate ("EA"). The coffee was decaffeinated by Descafecol, in Tolima, who use sugar cane as one of their main sources for the naturally occurring chemical needed for the process (hence the nickname "sugar cane decaf", which is likely only one of the sources of EA). This year the exporter we work with opened their own buying warehouse in town in order to have a more direct hand in how the coffee and payments are being managed. It was perhaps the most competitive year for buying in Colombia that we've seen in over a decade, with the local price soaring to nearly double what it was last year. When the margin between base price and microlot price narrows to such a degree, farmers have less incentive to separate out their best coffee for a meager second payment. So this year we paid higher prices than ever in order to maintain those longstanding relationships and get the coffees we want - including those that went into this decaf. Farms are typically planted in Caturra and Variedad Colombia (F4 and F6 types), grown at altitudes between 1700 and 2100 meters, and each contributing lot in this batch are wet process coffees.	Farm Gate	The smells in the ground coffee had malty sweetness that reminded me of brown bread made with molasses, and a hint of spice. Adding hot water pulled out more of the malt aspects, with bittersweetness that came together like malted chocolate, and beer grains. The cup had a subtle spiced aroma when roasted light that brought some complexity to the cup, with caramel and molasses hints, apple, and a doughy cinnamon roll accent. It also had fairly moderate acidity for decaf coffee, which helps it fly under the radar as being decaf without a regular coffee next to it for comparison! Full City roasts produced a smoked chocolate flavor, with toasted nibs and a woodsy pine accent. Body is on the medium side for decaf, but  it certainly passes the muster as bittersweet espresso at Full City or darker.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/colombia-buesaco-ea-decaf-7930.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:07:28
228	Brazil Dry Process Alex Sandro	86	January 2024 Arrival	Serra do Salitre, Minas Geraís	Dry Process (Natural)	Patio Sun-Dried	Full City to Full City+	62	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Catuaí	Estate 16 Up	.6 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Perfect medium-dark roast promising punchy low tones, substantial body, and winey hints. Bittersweet torte, chocolate liqueur, rustic cooked berry, raw cashew, low acidity.  Full City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Alex Sandro has worked in coffee his entire life, starting out helping his father on their family farm, planting coffee, maintaining plants, and preparation at the end of harvest. He eventually saved up his own money to invest in a farm of his own, Fazenda Fortaleza, in Serra do Salitre. His farm sits at a modest 1000 meters above sea level, and is mostly planted in Red Catuaí, a Brazilian hybrid coffee variety made by crossing Mundo Novo and Caturra, and known for its compact size, and high yields. This lot comes from an intermediary we started working with a few years back in Sao Sebastiao do Paraíso who we found to have access to a lot of really interesting single farm lots in Minas Geraís, as well as to the north in Bahía. We tried to visit his farm when passing through Serra do Salitre earlier this year (Aug '24), but unfortunately the timing did not work out. We hope to on our next visit!	Farm Gate	This coffee promises hefty bittersweet flavors and substantial body at Full City, with winey-fruit accent notes that bring an interesting complexity to the cup profile. The ground coffee smelled of rich baking chocolate, toasted nut, and wisps of cedar smoke. The wet aroma had a bit more sweetness, with an earthy note of raw cacao, and hint of canned fruit. Robust roast notes dominated the cup at Full City and Full City+, deep dark chocolate flavors, bittersweet torte, high % cacao bar, and more. A winey accent comes up as the coffee cools, which brought to mind chocolate liqueur, and some rustic cooked berries in the backend. Notes of creamy cherimoya and raw cashew marked the aroma, and acidity is quite low, and unobtrusive. I'm enjoying this dark roasted Brazil solo, but it will do well with cream too given the punchy bittersweetness, and thick body. Espresso shots were so syrupy and delicious at Full City, with a note of creamy dark chocolate, accented by black cherry and toasted coconut.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/brazil-dry-process-alex-sandro-7875.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:36:50
229	Brazil Dry Process Marcio Martins	86	January 2024 Arrival	Alto Mogiana, Sao Paulo	Dry Process (Natural)	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	48	60 KG	Ecotact Liner	1	Catuaí, Catucaí	Estate 16 Up	.4 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen	Struck us as an "everyday" Brazilian coffee that'll work well for milk drinks and espresso. Dark chocolate with puffed rice, smokey burnt sugar, savory sesame, long cocoa powder finish. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Marcio Martins' coffee farm, "Monte Alto e Mimosa", is located in the Alto Mogiana region of Sao Paulo, bordering Minas Geraís. After graduating with a degree in agronomy, Marcio established his first farm on family-owned property. Initially starting with cows and coffee, his focus soon shifted to growing coffee exclusively. (Cows are a very typical sight at coffee farms in Sao Paulo, and it's no wonder agriculture in this region is commonly referred to as "coffee and cream"). His farm sits at right around 1000 meters above sea level, and is planted with mostly Catucaí and Catuaí varieties. He only produces dry process coffee at this time ("naturals"), drying the coffee on cement patios at the farm. We found his coffee makes a crowd pleasing cup in the middle roasts, and doubles nicely as chocolaty espresso!	Farm Gate	The ground coffee showed a mix of dark cocoa and savory accents of roasted nut, and leather. The wet aroma pulled together a scent of drinking cocoa powder, toffee almond, and something like toasted rice crackers. The chocolate and grain combination came through nicely in the cup profile too, with body supporting weighty low tones, and a very mild acidic impression. City+ roasts brought out flavors of chocolates with puffed rice, and a carbonized sugar note that added a pungent smokey sweetness to the cup, along with a savory hint of sesame in the aroma. Full City roast showed deeper roast tones, such as smoked chocolate, high % cacao bar, and a long bittering cocoa powdery finish. We really enjoyed Marcio Martins' coffee in the medium roast levels. It struck us as the "everyday" type of crowd pleasing Brazil that will work for milk drinks and espresso too.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/brazil-dry-process-marcio-martins-7865.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:36:53
230	Brazil Dry Process Matheus Pereira	86	January 2024 Arrival	Alfenas, Minas Geraís	Dry Process (Natural)	Patio Sun-Dried	Full City to Full City+	21	60 KG	Ecotact Liner	1	Catuaí, Mundo Novo	Estate 16 Up	.6 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen	Strong showing of bittersweetness that pairs well with thick body and mild acidity. Cocoa-tinged profiles of 70% cacao bar, semi-sweet chocolate chips, and fudgey brownies with nuts. Full City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Unfortunately, we were not able to visit Matheus on our last trip to Brazil in August 2024. His farm, Santa Izabel, is located in Alfenas, which is in the southern part of the state of Minas Geraís, an area that was not super close to our route. What we do know, is that Matheus started planting coffee at Santa Izabel in 2010. The farm is just 16 hectares, which is a manageable size for one family. Brazil is unique in that most harvesting is performed with machinery, which makes it possible for 1 or 2 people to harvest an entire farm, rather than 20+ if it were harvested by hand. The farm sits at 820 meters above sea level, and Matheus has chosen to stick with mostly Mundo Novo and Catuaí varieties.	Farm Gate	I roasted this coffee to City+ and Full City, and felt that the latter was where the best balance of dark roast notes and sweetness was found. There's a strong showing of bittersweetness that pairs well with thick body, and milder acidity. The ground coffee had a scent of molasses drizzled on roasted nuts, with a moderate level of sweetness backing bittering roast notes. The cup flavors carried prominent bittersweetness, though mild on the actual "bitter" side. That is to say, the sweetness came through quite well in our cup tests, and brought to mind notes of milder dark chocolate, like 70% cacao bar, and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I picked up on a ripe hint of fruit, but the cup profile was mostly cocoa-tinged profiles, like dark chocolate syrup, and fudgey brownies with walnuts and almonds. Should make a knockout espresso!	https://www.sweetmarias.com/brazil-dry-process-matheus-pereira-7862.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:36:57
231	Brazil Duas Fazendas SWP Decaf	87	July 2024 Arrival	Sul de Minas	Dry Process, then Swiss Water Process Decaf	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	93	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon, Catuaí	Estate	1 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen - some broken and misshaped beans due to decaffeination	All the flavor of a nice Brazilian coffee without the caffeine! Pleasant cup sweetness at City+ with accents of toffee peanut, almond, caramel, and bittersweet cocoa powder. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This coffee comes to us from two farms in the region of Sul de Minas, Mantiqueira micro region, an area that boasts over 2000 smaller coffee farms. They started off as non-decaf coffees that we liked so much, we peeled off a few pallets specifically to send off for decaffeination. All of our decafs are processed by Swiss Water Process in Canada, whose patented process uses only water to remove  99.9% of the caffeine content and leaving much of the volatile compounds intact. A bit about the farms that went into this decaf: At roughly 30-50 hectares each, the farm sizes aren't "small" when comparing with the small holder farms we buy from in regions like Colombia for example. But they're small for Brazil, home to massive estates with fully mechanized harvesting operations. These smaller estates still manually pick coffee as opposed to using machinery, allowing for better separation of ripe and underripe cherry. The farms are located around the Pedra Branca mountians, plantings in the 1300 meter range and planted mainly in Yellow Bourbon and Catuai. I was pleasantly surprised to hear an audible 'snap' at the first signs of fracturing, which isn't always the case with decaf. This one's not too difficult to judge roast development by sound, but sight is always a little trickier since the coffee is already degraded and dark from the decaf process. Try pulling it a little sooner than you think and adjust from there.	Farm Gate, Decaf	The dry fragrance had sweet nut tones, roasted almond shadowed by mild molasses notes, and a waxy honey comb smell. Full City roasts had convincing chocolate smells, and some chocolate sesame. The wet aroma was a tad sweeter, and showed an interesting mix of fruit and nut, like granola bar, with toasted seeds, hazelnut. If you're wanting the flavors of a nice Brazilian coffee without the caffeine, Duas Fazendas is it! We found that we actually preferred the flavor profile to some of our non-decafs, actually. The cup sweetness was quite nice at City+, with flavor accents of toffee peanut and almond folded into a sweet layer of caramel. There was even noticable acidic impression at this roast level which really rounded out the cup. The finish had cocoa,and creamy nut tones, and if I had to complain about something, it would be that it's a bit short. Overall, we're very pleased with how this decaf turned out and think it fits right in with Brazils on our list, and even milder Central American coffees too.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/brazil-duas-fazendas-swp-decaf-7984.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:00
232	Brazil Pulp Natural Laura Junqueira	86	December 2023 Arrival	Santa Rita do Sacupaí, Mantiqueira, Minas Gerais	Pulp Natural	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	78	60 KG	Ecotact Liner	1	Mundo Novo, Acaiá, Catuaí Amarelo, Arara, Catucaí	Estate	.4 d/300 grams, 15-17 Screen	It's a pleasantly simple coffee, tied to bittersweetness, and subtle top note hints, such as honey-nut, zucchini bread, sesame cookie, and a faint dried apple note. Prime for milk drinks. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Laura Junqueira is a third generation coffee coffee farmer who, along with her father, Roberto Machado ("Beto"), run the 150 hectare farm, Fazenda São José Condado. The farm has stood much longer than the Junqueira family has owned it, dating back to the mid 1800's when the first coffee was planted and the original farm house was built. The farm is located just outside of Santa Rita do Sacupaí in the Mantiqueira Region of Minas Gerais. The land at São José is actually 508 hectares, much of which is still natural forest. It requires a fairly large team to manage just the part planted in coffee, and there are 22 permanent employees year round, as well as 100 seasonal workers who join for the harvest. The farm enjoys a modest altitude of 1200 meters above sea level, and is currently planted in Mundo Novo, Acaiá, Catuaí Amarelo, Catuaí Vermelho, Arara, and Catucaí. While much of Brazil coffee farmers have turned to harvesting machinery, the Junqueira family recognizes the importance of selecting ripe cherries in order to produce top grades, and has therefore chosen to stick with selective harvesting by hand. This lot is a pulp natural process which is about as closed to a fully washed coffee as you will get in Brazil, and quite similar to a mild honey process method in Costa Rica. The coffee cherry and much of the fruit are removed with depulping machinery, and then the seed is laid to dry with fruit mucilage still intact. Pulp naturals often possess more balanced flavors than dry process coffee, less fruited, and can still be big-bodied and lower acid coffees, making them a great choice for espresso and blending.	Farm Gate	Aromatically speaking, this lot from Laura Junqueira had an understated raw sugar sweetness at City+ roast level, malted bread, wheat puff, and bittersweet at the edges. There was a sweet nuttiness in the steam after pouring hot water on the grounds, like peanut butter cookie. Brewing the coffee produced a mild mix of unrefined sugar and faint accents, with cocoa bittersweetness rounding out the cup. It's a pleasantly simple coffee, tied to bittersweetness, and subtle top note hints. City+ brews had accents of honey-nut, zucchini bread, sesame cookie, and a faint dried apple note. Full City brought out cocoa, and body, and struck me as a prime option for milk drinks and espresso.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/brazil-pulp-natural-laura-junqueira-7824.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:03
233	Brazil Pulp Natural Santa Ines	85	December 2023 Arrival	Carmo de Minas, Minas Geraís	Pulp Natural	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	55	59 KG	Ecotact Liner	1	Yellow Bourbon	Estate 16 Up	.8 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen	Moderately bittersweet flavors, with the soft acidity you'd expect from Brazil. Body is thick and carries notes of dark cocoa, carob, butter nut toffee, barley tea, and hazelnut. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Santa Ines is a offee from the Sertao family of farms, adjacent to the large farm we have bought many times, that of Nazareth Dias Pereira (we also have a lot from "Fazenda Sertao" right now, another of their farms). The farm is owned by Francisco Isidro Dias Pereira who has 75 hectares dedicated to coffee with a total size of 215 hectares of land. Santa Ines is located in Carmo de Minas at 1100 meters, and this lot is 100% Yellow Bourbon cultivar. Yellow Bourbon is a sub-type that has fruit which ripens to a yellow color. It originated in Brazil. It is possible that Yellow Bourbon is a natural mutation of a cross between Bourbon and a yellow-fruited Typica called "Amarelo de Botocatu". Bourbon coffees are named for the island in the India Ocean where French colonists grew it. It's not so different in the cup than Red Bourbon, but I have noticed higher sugar levels in the Yellow fruit, and the plant has different physical properties.	Farm Gate	The dry fragrance has a praline nut smell, savory accents, and cocoa. The wet aroma echoes these smells, with sweetness that's a bit like peanut candies, with dark cocoa bittersweetness. City+ and Full City roasts bring out moderately bittersweet flavors in the brewed coffee, with notes of caramelized sugar, butter nut toffee, and a sweet grain flavor that comes off like carob in the aftertaste. Pulp natural processing makes for a nice mild Brazil cup, with softness you'd expect in relation to acidity. The body is thick, especially with more roast development, and dark roasts will bring intense bittersweetness and thick mouthfeel. There's a classic nutty Brazil roast tone (hazelnut in particular) turning more toward cocoa powder in the darker levels at Full City/FC+ roasts. Lighter shades are a bit more delicate, sweet and savor flavors at the core, with a barley tea accent. I enjoyed both and find it works very well for SO espresso in a wide range of roasts.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/brazil-pulp-natural-santa-ines-7829.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:07
234	Burundi Dry Process Kibingo	88	March 2024 Arrival	Kayanza Province	Dry Process (Natural)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	60	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon	A1	.6 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Flavors shift with roast level. Notes of cooked fruit, tart hints of berry and citrus, bittersweet backdrop, and barley malt syrup note that adds an earthy, aromatic quality. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Unlike wet processing, where the cherry and fruit are removed before drying, dry process coffees ("natural") are laid out with the cherry intact through the entire drying phase. With the fruit intact, dry times increase 3 to 4 fold, taking upwards to a month depending on weather. Dry process coffees tend to be fruit-forward, sometimes even "winey" in a slightly fermented flavor, bodied and acidity flattened to some degree. What we have here with Kibingo is a clean example of dry process coffee with a lot of fruit character, never quite reaching the "ferment" flavors. Kibingo Station is a coffee cherry collection site located in Kayanza, Burundi's northern province that borders neighboring Rwanda. The washing station acts as a central delivery site for a few thousand small holder famers who occupy the 18 hills that surround Kibingo. Kibingo sits at just under 1900 meters above sea level, and many of the farmers have coffee planted much higher than this. Kibingo is named after reeds that are growing in the river running alongside the station site, planted in order to help keep the soil at the banks from eroding. They've been around since the mid 1980s, and a couple years back, took 1st place at the Burundi Cup of Excellence competition, no small feat.	Farm Gate	The level to which Kibingo shows fruit can vary quite a bit depending on roast level. My City and City+ roasts showed more pronounced fruit tones than at Full City, with a backdrop of rustic bittersweets. Full City, however, was more of a low-toned cup, still delicious, but the bittersweetness overpowered any process flavors of fruit. The dry fragrance had cocoa-dusted dried fruits, and raisin. Pouring hot water brought out a clean sweetness of stewed fruits. The brewed coffee had flavorsome notes of cooked fruits, like dates, and plums, along with a slightly tart note that brought out subtle profiles of raspberry and citrus. Cooling off some, the coffee shows a rustic sweetness like barley malt syrup in the background, unrefined and aromatic, that opened up to dried fruit hints. My Full City roast married bittersweet cocoa powder flavors to soft dark fruit hints, and the finish was long and smokey. Acidity was on the quiet side and slight, which is a net positive if looking for a dry process coffee for espresso. The only sharpness found in the shot will be bittersweetness, as the fruited notes don't have much bite.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/burundi-dry-process-kibingo-7883.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:10
235	Colombia Buesaco EA Decaf	87	March 2024 Arrival	Buesaco, Nariño, Cauca	Wet Process (Washed) then EA Decaf ("Sugarcane")	Covered Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	58	70 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Caturra, Variedad Colombia, Typica	Estate	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Caramel accents, malted grains, spiced aroma, doughy cinnamon roll, smoked chocolate, woodsy accent, and moderate acidity helps it fly under the radar as decaf. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This decaf was sourced from small producers near Buesaco town, in Colombia's Nariño Department. We chose the coffees specifically for decaffeination, based on the cup profiles having some mild fruit characteristics and pronounced acidity. In our experience, those types of cup attributes will withstand some of the gentler decaffeination methods, such as this ethyl acetate ("EA"). The coffee was decaffeinated by Descafecol, in Tolima, who use sugar cane as one of their main sources for the naturally occurring chemical needed for the process (hence the nickname "sugar cane decaf", which is likely only one of the sources of EA). This year the exporter we work with opened their own buying warehouse in town in order to have a more direct hand in how the coffee and payments are being managed. It was perhaps the most competitive year for buying in Colombia that we've seen in over a decade, with the local price soaring to nearly double what it was last year. When the margin between base price and microlot price narrows to such a degree, farmers have less incentive to separate out their best coffee for a meager second payment. So this year we paid higher prices than ever in order to maintain those longstanding relationships and get the coffees we want - including those that went into this decaf. Farms are typically planted in Caturra and Variedad Colombia (F4 and F6 types), grown at altitudes between 1700 and 2100 meters, and each contributing lot in this batch are wet process coffees.	Farm Gate	The smells in the ground coffee had malty sweetness that reminded me of brown bread made with molasses, and a hint of spice. Adding hot water pulled out more of the malt aspects, with bittersweetness that came together like malted chocolate, and beer grains. The cup had a subtle spiced aroma when roasted light that brought some complexity to the cup, with caramel and molasses hints, apple, and a doughy cinnamon roll accent. It also had fairly moderate acidity for decaf coffee, which helps it fly under the radar as being decaf without a regular coffee next to it for comparison! Full City roasts produced a smoked chocolate flavor, with toasted nibs and a woodsy pine accent. Body is on the medium side for decaf, but  it certainly passes the muster as bittersweet espresso at Full City or darker.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/colombia-buesaco-ea-decaf-7930.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:14
236	Colombia Honey Aponte El Páramo	88	December 2024 Arrival	Vereda El Páramo, Aponte, Tablón de Gomez, Nariño	Honey Process	Covered Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	16	70 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Caturra, Variedad Colombia, Typica	Excelso 15+	.2 d/300gr, 15+ Screen	Solid core sweetness suspends fruit flavors of cooked berries, juicy plum and grape, along with rustic elements of dried tamarind, and fermented orange. Impressively bittersweet and bodied too. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This honey processed coffee comes from an indigenous group in a nearby region called Aponte, just east of Buesaco town. Our "Aponte" honey process blend is made up of coffee from the broader Aponte region, however this lot is comprised of coffee from two neighboring farmers, Eduardo and Lauerano Martinez, who live in the Aponte village of 'El Páramo'. The people of Aponte are Inga decent, a pre-Colombian ethnic group related to the Incas, their native tongue being Inga Kichwa. Aponte is located in a misty páramo region around 1900 meters above sea level and the farmers in this growing region produce mainly Caturra an Variedad Colombia, the latter being a disease resistant hybrid. What's interesting about the coffee from this region is that honey processing is the standard post harvest process method. Each producer handles their own processing at home too, which can mean quite a bit of flavor variation from one neighbor to the next. The land where the coffee is grown is owned by the community, but each producer is in charge of specific plots and can sell the coffee they produce. Honey Processing is a processing method where the coffee cherry and some of the fruit is mechanically removed, leaving behind a thin layer of fruit which is then laid out on raised beds to dry. Drying can take more than 2 weeks, the prolonged exposure to the coffee fruit causing a very subtle and slow fermentation to occur, and often imparts fruit-like flavors in the coffee itself. The fruited elements in this particular lot are tempered by hefty bittersweetness (especially when roasted to Full City and beyond!).	Farm Gate	This honey process lot from the El Páramo region in Aponte is freighted with plump fruits, and unrefined sugar sweetness. Aromatically speaking, the coffee produces juicy notes of red fruits, stewed plums, and underlying sweetness of blackstrap molasses. This brewed coffee has a very nice core sweetness in the cup too, suspending the fruit flavors nicely in the profile. The cup shows impressive fruit notes across the roast spectrum, like cooked berries, juicy plum and grape, along with some more rustic aspects of dried tamarind, and fermented orange. Full City roasts are syrupy and bittersweet, and still offers convincing dark berry tones in flavor and aroma. El Páramo ticks off a lot of boxes for espresso, too, with thick, creamy mouthfeel, dense chocolate flavors, and red fruits edging into the mix. Honey process coffees produce a lot more chaff than washed, which is something to be aware of when roasting. They also present darker in color, so it's worth paying close attention to the time of 1st Crack so that you can map out when to drop your batch.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/colombia-honey-aponte-el-paramo-8156.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:17
237	Colombia Inzá Vereda San Antonio	88	December 2024 Arrival	Vereda San Antonio, Inzá, Cauca	Wet Process (Washed)	Covered Sun-Dried	City to Full City	12	70 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon, Caturra, Typica, Variedad Colombia	Excelso 15+	.5 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Pronounced sweetness with lively brightness that's mouth refreshing in light roasts. Raw sugar sweetness at the front of the cup, juicy fruit accents, honey-sweetened black tea, and subtle spice notes impact aroma. City to Full City+.	This blend of coffee from Inzá is made up of coffees from small producers in Vereda San Antonio, Inzá ("vereda" being the equivalent of a small neighborhood). This time around we have 12 bags in total from three different farms in San Antonio town. The province of Inzá is located in Southwestern Colombia within the greater Department of Cauca. As you make the drive from La Plata to Inzá, you follow the Rio Páez, and an eventual crossing over a suspension bridge lands you on the road to the the villages whose coffees make up this blend. Like much of Colombia, Cauca is home to some very high altitude farms, many breaching the 2000 meter mark, the coffee from this lot harvested from an altitude range of about 1600 to 2000 meters. The way we make up these regional blends is by cupping several samples from the individual farms, separating out those that meet a certain cup criteria, and then blending them together. This is a wet-processed coffee, most farmers using old style hand-cranked pulpers, fermenting and washing in the same tank, and then drying out on raised, covered beds. Most farms have a healthy amount of Caturra planted, as well as some of the common Timor hybrids you see in Colombia, like Variedad Colombia and Tabi, that were produced for disease resistance and higher productivity.	Farm Gate	The dry fragrance of my City roast had a clean raw sugar sweetness with accents of fragrant caramel and spice. After pouring the hot water, the coffee smelled very sweet, and pullec out a scent of light brown sugar, spiced tea, and dried apple. This coffee from San Antonio makes a very sweet cup at a wide range of roasts, with lively brightness that's mouth refreshing in light roasts. City and City+ roasts boasted raw sugar flavors at the front of the cup, accented by fruited hints of golden raisin, juicy plum, and some fruit skin bittering in the finish. As I moved through the cup, the cooling coffee delivered a tart-to-sweet aspect that brought to mind honey-sweetened black tea, with subtle spice notes that impacted the cup aroma, and made for a complex aftertaste. The mild top notes provided uniquely contrast to the balanced bittersweet flavors, and the acidic impression shifted from tangy citrus to tannic teas. Full City roasts also rated quite high in sweetness, with a flavor profile of vanilla caramels balancing out mild cocoa bittersweets, and a contrasting hint of a Earl Grey.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/colombia-inza-vereda-san-antonio-8155.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:20

Full City develops a low-toned, bittersweet coffee, rich chocolate torte, Dutch cocoa, and dried date. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This "Veredas Vecinas" blend is made up of coffees from neighboring villages in Inzá, Cauca. While the regions are hardly neighboring each other, the veredas ("villages") where they were pulled from are. The bulk of the coffee is from a buying operation in San Antonio, within the Southwestern Colombian region of Inzá de Cauca. As you make the drive from La Plata to Inzá, you follow the Rio Páez, and an eventual crossing over a suspension bridge lands you on the road to the villages where we buy coffee. Like much of Colombia, Cauca is home to very high altitude farms, many above the 2000 meter mark. The coffees that make up this lot were harvested from an altitude range of about 1500 to 2000 meters. We make up these regional blends by cupping several samples from the individual farms, separating out those that meet a certain cup criteria, and then blend them together. Having this level of quality control with our Colombian blends is a great benefit to us, and allows us to really mix and match coffees to come up with a flavor profile that no single coffee could achieve on its own. This is a wet-processed coffee, most farmers using old style depulpers that are powered by hand-crank or small motors, then fermenting and washing the coffee in the same tank, and finally drying the coffee in covered drying rooms called "parabolicos".	Farm Gate	The dry fragrance has balanced sweetness and low tones all the way up to Full City+ (beginning of 2nd crack), with accents of unrefined sugars, molasses, brown bread, and bittersweet cocoa in the more developed roasts. The wet crust has a very attractive smell of caramel and malt syrup, with hints of toasted nut, and peach pie filling. City and City+ roasts showed persistent sweetness in the brewed coffee, with accents of brown sugars, and caramel sauce. There's a balance of bright brightness and body, with hints of orange, and tangy golden raisin. Veredas Vecinas delivers deep low tones when taken to Full City, with flavor profile of bittersweet chocolate torte, Dutch drinking cocoa, and a note of dried date. This coffee is big-bodied no matter roast level, with pleasing, rounded mouthfeel that lends to a long aftertaste. For those looking for a Colombian espresso option, expect syrupy chocolate with a flash of dried fruit, viscous mouthfeel and lasting bittersweet finish.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/colombia-inza-veredas-vecinas-8152.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:24

Dark roasts pull out low-toned cocoa and hints of berry. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This lot is a blend of coffees from small producers in the town of China Alta, not too far from Ibagué, Tolima's capitol city. It was purchased through a local coffee association in China Alta where farmers are paid premiums for their coffees based on quality, rather than receive a flat price. A percentage of the profits is also returned to association members in the form of agronomical and business support. The coffees in China Alta are grown between 1850 and 1950 meters above sea level and the cultivars typically grown are Caturra and Variedad Colombia. Some of the farmers are mixing batches from up to a few days in the fermentation tanks, changing the water with each days addition in order to keep the coffee from over fermenting. We've seen this in a lot of other parts of Colombia too, and when managed properly, can lead to a fairly fruited cup for a wet-process coffee.	Farm Gate	I was impressed by the sweetness in smells, ranging from caramelized sugars, to dried fruits. The wetted grounds pulled out a scent of dark sugars that are accented by hints of toasted marshmallow, and a note of raisin and dried date. The cup sweetness was very nice in both our City and Full City roasts. Light roasts were laced with notes of unrefined sugars, creamy caramel, and a hint of candied walnut. Fruit notes are subtle, but do play a part of the cup profile, like red apple, and persimmons. The finish had some complex tea-tannin bittering, and understated suggestions of woody whole spices in the nose. Darker roasts raised deep cocoa low tones and a hint of blackberry. I found these darker roasts to be a good option for espresso as well, creamy-textured and bittersweet, with soft accent notes of red berry and cardamom.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/colombia-tolima-china-alta-8162.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:28

Dried fruits like peach, apple and pear, with an acetic winey accent, and spiced-sweet aroma that's like Belgian style beer. City to Full City.	The Katana station is one of a handful of Congo coffee processing sites under a privately ran coffee project called Virunga Coffee. Their primary goals have been to help increase production and the overall quality of the coffee through investment in infrastructure like wet mills and raised drying beds, farmer outreach and access to the global market. The Katana site is located in South Kivu and serves several hundred farmers in the region. Katana sits at 1700 meters above sea level and the farmed area spans a range of 1450 to 1750 meters, benefiting from high altitude and nutrient rich, volcanic soil. Farmers are growing Blue Mountain, a mutation of Typica first discovered in the Jamaica's Blue Mountains. Katana are only producing natural and honey process coffees which have a much lower demand for water. The Virunga Coffee group have also assisted with certifications (UTZ and Organic) that not only lend to sustainable agricultural practice, but also ensure an added price premium for the coffee.	Organic/Fair Trade Cert.	It's been a while since we've had a Congolese coffee on our list, so it brings us great pleasure to stock this fruity natural from Katana washing station. The ground coffee smelled of dark cocoa accented by notes of fruits and berries, and pouring hot water pulled out a mix of dried fruits and rustic sweetness. The cup flavors are predictably fruited, though I noticed a slight drop in the intensity level when actually brewing this coffee, as opposed to cupping it from a spoon. We honed in on dried fruit flavors like peach, apple, and pear, along with an acetic, winey accent in the finish. The cup aroma had a contemplative note of Belgian style beer, a malty-sweetness accented by hints cardamom and coriander. At Full City the fruits are tempered by moderate bittersweetness underneath, though interspersed with syrupy dark fruit flavors. The cooling cup shows a hint of spice, along with notes of pipe tobacco, chocolate liqueur, and body as big as the flavor profile. Lovers of fruity dry process African coffees should definitely have this Congo coffee on their radar!	https://www.sweetmarias.com/congo-organic-dry-process-kabare-katana-7833.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:31
241	Costa Rica Dry Process Hacienda Sonora	88	September 2024 Arrival	Alajuela, Central Valley	Dry Process (Natural)	Raised Bed Sun Dried	City to Full City	40	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Centroamericano	SHB EP	.7 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen, a few partial quakers in our 200 gram roasts	Displays the kind of fruit-forward, winey flavors that fans of anaerobic coffees should love! Blackberry, pomegranate molasses, cinnamon apple sauce, dried prune, fruity wine, and rum-like aroma. City to Full City.	This coffee from Hacienda Sonora is part of a family operation that goes back five generations in Costa Rica's West Valley region. The Guardia family have farmed coffee here for more than 100 years, historically selling their harvest to large mills, as was the norm. That all changed in the late 90's with the micro-mill revolution that swept Costa Rica, and, seeing value in controlling their coffee quality through to export, the family erected their own small milling operation at their farm. Currently under the management of Diego Guardia, the farm have decided to move away from more water intensive process methods, favoring honey and dry process instead. This bag lot is "dry process", meaning the whole coffee cherries are laid to dry, rather than being removed from the green seed. This process method can impact the cup flavors and physical characteristics too. In the case of this coffee, it possesses fruit and wine-like notes, big body, no doubt tied to process method. The beans also look a little darker when roasting, and produce a lot more chaff than a fully washed coffee. Hacienda Sonora sits at 1300 meters above sea level, and is planted in a variety of cultivars, including this Caturra separation, which is a natural mutation of old Bourbon types initially discovered in Brazil, and known for high cup quality.	Farm Gate	This coffee is definitely of the "wild and wooly" variety, however, some balance is struck between core rustic sweetness and nuanced fruit notes from process method. It has the kind of fruit-forward, winey flavors that fans of anaerobic coffees should love. The dry fragrance is very sweet in the City-City+ roast range, and presents an underlying note of blackstrap molasses that lays out a nice background for contrasting hints of fermented fruits, and maraschino cherries. The wet aroma has a scent of rustic natural sweeteners (date sugar came to mind), with notes of berry crumble, and plum wine. The cup shows fruit flavors that are both sweet and winey, and carry a kind of complex fermented intensity. Body is a big part of the experience too, and acidity is on the low to mid-level, which actually works well in this context. The flavor profiles in my City+ roast touched on blackberry filling, tangy fruit wines, pomegranate molasses, cinnamon apple sauce, and a rum-like aroma in the nose. Full City roast pushed bittersweetness toward the front too, but still brewed fruit flavors of dried prune, and spice.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/costa-rica-dry-process-hacienda-sonora-7991.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:34
242	Costa Rica Honey Process Nace	87	September 2024 Arrival	Los Santos, San Marcos, Tarrazu	Honey Process	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	33	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Caturra	SHB EP	.7 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen - we had a few partial quakers in our roasts	Sweet-savory smells lead to more prominent fruit flavors in the cup, like stewed plums, dried apricot and earthy dates, along with a bright note of cinnamon tea, and low-toned bittersweets. City to Full City+.	This coffee comes from a family run micro mill called Coffee Nace in Los Santos, Tarrazu. "Nace" is a portmanteau of sorts, blending the two family names of Navarro and Ceciliano into one. Apolinio, the matriarch of the family, built the mill more than a decade ago to process the coffee from his family's coffee farms (including his own). Now 93, Apolinio relies on the help of his 6 children to manage production at Coffee Nace and the farms throughout the harvest season. This particular lot is all Caturra, pulled from a part of their farm that sits around 1400 meters above sea level. It is a honey process, which means that some of the coffee fruit is left intact to the seed during the entire drying phase. That extra moisture from the fruit slows the drying process, and often imparts body, fruit, and round off acidity to some degree. It also leads to the coffee looking much darker when roasting, and produces a lot of chaff. It's not hard to roast, per se, but you should pay closer attention to time and the audible snaps, rather than physical coloring for judging roast degree.	Farm Gate	I found the sweetness in the dried fragrance to have savory accents of walnut and toasted nuts, along with a note of fruit. The range of sweet smells expanded in the wet aroma, unrefined sugars, peanut butter cookie, and stewed fruit were some of the main features we noted. City roasts showed more fruit than the smells led on. The profiles had flavor aspects of stewed plums, dried apricot and earthy dates. As the coffee cooled off, some brighter notes gained definition, with cinnamon tea accent note that played into the acidic impression. There were some indications of bittersweet cocoa beneath the flavors, but pretty reserved at this roast level. It's the medium-dark roast levels that bring out low-toned flavors, a bittersweetness front to back that tasted like dark chocolate truffles, interspersed with hints of cooked cherry and red berry. It makes a very delicious dark roast, and cools to understated rustic fruit accents, and a complex smokey cocoa aftertaste.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/costa-rica-honey-process-nace-7992.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:38
243	Costa Rica Red Honey Don Oscar	88	August 2024 Arrival	Tarrazu	Honey Process	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to City+	35	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Villalobos, Catuaí	SHB EP	.4 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen	Light roasts are brightly accented, honey-sweet, with aromatic top notes of chamomile tea, lemon sage, and coriander, and hints of fruit that fade to dark tea tannins in a pleasantly bittering aftertaste. City to City+.	This was one of the coffees that stood out from the pack when cupping offers in Costa Rica last March. I noted it was brighter, with delicate aromatic top notes. If the roasted coffee hadn't been on the cupping table, I would've guessed it was Pacamara. Finding out it has Villalobos variety in it helped make sense of the fragrant aroma. Villalobos is a natural dwarf mutation of Typica found mostly in Costa Rica, that often expresses interesting flavors and pronounced acidity. The "El Coyote" farm is run by Horacio and Alejandro Solis, in Tarrazu's Talamanca Sierra highland region, where they operate the La Casona micro mill. Their farm is broken into 40 different lots, each with distinct demarcation, and a different mix of varieties. El Coyote is planted in Villalobos and Catuaí, and stretches upward of 2000 meters above sea level. This is a red honey process coffee, which means that after the outer cherry is pulped, the sticky fruit mucilage is left intact to the coffee seeds during the drying phase. It turns a reddish color when dry, which is how it got the name "red honey". We often find that red honey coffees have fruitier flavors than washed, and while I wouldn't call this coffee "fruity", it certainly offers clean fruit accents. Honey process coffees tend to present darker when roasting, and also produce a lot of chaff. It's not hard to roast, per se, but you should pay closer attention to time and the audible snaps, rather than physical coloring for judging roast degree.	Farm Gate	When I initially tasted this coffee during my March visit to Costa Rica, I was impressed by the aromatic top notes. The profiles are light and delicate, with fresh herbal highlights that reminded me of some of our best examples of Pacamara, Maracaturra, and Parainema varieties. They have a lot of Villalobos planted at the farm, which helps makes sense of this. Light roasts have an herbaceous sweetness in the ground coffee, a little floral, like chamomile flower, with interesting complexity to the sweetness, like medicinal honey. The wet aroma when pouring hot water on the grounds has an incredibly attractive smell, with sweetness reaching a floral pitch, like opening a bag light brown sugar, and accented by delicate notes of elderflower, and citrus. The sweetness has staying power in the brew, and creates a nice base tone for the the complex top notes to hang on. I get aromatic honey in the cup, with very nice herbal accent notes that impact the aromatic profile. Think chamomile tea, lemon sage, and coriander. City roasts have a crisp red apple note, with a hint of mandarin orange, that fade to some dark tea tannins in a pleasantly bittering finish. The only dark roast I tried was almost Full City+, and just before 2nd Cracks (438F). While maybe too dark for my taste, there was a pretty high level of sweetness that fed into the bittersweet roast flavors, and something about the 'roast' smokiness and sweetness brought to mind toasted coconut. While it was really delicious dark roast, I'll stick to the lighter end of the spectrum.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/costa-rica-red-honey-el-coyote-8030.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:41
244	Costa Rica Tarrazu El Mango	87	August 2024 Arrival	San Marcos, Tarrazú	Machine Washed	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	30	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Caturra, Catuaí	SHB EP	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Cleanly bright and full of sweetness, hearkens back to a "Classic" Costa Rican profile that I can drink every day! Dark sugar, molasses cookie, caramelized notes, bright tea and lemon accents. City to Full City.	This microlot is a blend of coffees from the various plots managed by Cesar Esquivel at Cerro La Cruz, in Tarrazu. This particular lot is mechanically washed, which means that in stead of using fermentation to remove the sticky fruit after depulping, they strip both cherry and fruit away using a mechanical demucilager equipment. It's the same machinery used to produce honeys. A simple adjustment to the demucilager affects how much fruit is left intact after depulping. The more fruit, the wilder the cup flavors. This lot was processed as what's referred to as "White Honey" in Costa Rica, which just means they remove as much fruit as possible without scoring the seed. The resulting cup is a close approximation to "fully washed", fermented coffee, with clean cup flavors, and acidity that sparkles. There is a bit more chaff produced during roasting than a fully washed coffee, but nowhere near the amount of dry process or honey process coffees. The coffee also presents darker during the roasting process, which is something to pay attention to when judging roast level, as they are often slightly lighter than they appear. The city of San Marcos is in the Talamanca Sierra highlands, with peaks reaching as high as 3000 meters. It's an ideal micro-region and climate for growing coffee with rich volcanic soil, great altitude, and is shaded from the hot afternoon suns by mountain peaks. The farms surrounding the Cerro La Cruz mill top out around 1900 meters above sea level.	Farm Gate	While I'm a fan of fruit flavors in coffee, I tend to reach for more simple ones that cleanly bright and full of sweetness. This lot from El Mango is just that, and hearkens back to a sort of "Classic" clean Costa Rican profile that I can drink every day! The dry fragrance possessed a scent of rapidura-type dark sugar, with a spiced sweetness of cinnamon toast. Pouring hot water on the grounds brought out a note of cinnamon oatmeal with brown sugar, along with hints of chocolate malted grains, and roasted nut. In the cup, I found light roasts possessed surprisingly developed sweetness (City/City+), and brisk acidity that structured the cup. Notes of dark sugar, and molasses cookie accent a somewhat caramelized bittersweet base flavor. A malty note comes up as the coffee cools, and brought out a flavor profile of brown ale. Bright notes impact the acidic impression and are at first tea-like and tannic, but also offer tangy citrus elements, like lemon. Full City roasts will blunt the acidic snap, and works well with the more low-toned cup flavors, like semi-sweet chocolate chips, 70% dark chocolate bar, and hot chocolate.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/costa-rica-tarrazu-el-mango-8025.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:45
245	Costa Rica Zarcero Monte Brisas	87	September 2024 Arrival	Zarcero, West Valley	Wet Process (Washed)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	35	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Villa Sarchi	SHB EP	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Balanced flavors, with nuanced hints that add interest to the cup profile. Core sweetness of raw sugars, with accents of apple, lemon tea, toffee almond, spiced cocoa, and mouth cleansing acidity. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Maria Elena Castro and son Luis Salazar opened their micro mill, Beneficio Monte Brisas, back in 2011 after years of delivering their coffee cherry to other mills and cooperatives. Maria Elena's farm, Finca La Salaca, sits at 1750 meters above sea level on the lush mountainous slopes of Zarcero in Costa Rica's famed West Valley growing region. The Pacific is the major influence in the West Valley with sprawling views of Naranjo and Alajuela readily available across it. Finca Salaca is planted with a lot of Villalobos varietal, some Villa Sarchi, and Caturra mixed in. This is a separation of Villa Sarchi, which is a natural mutation of Bourbon known for shorter stature ("dwarf"), high yield, and great cup potential - especially when grown at high altitudes. The Monte Brisas mill is incredibly clean and well cared for, and feels a bit like a museum with all of its meticulously maintained older machinery! The coffee is mechanically washed on a Desacafe machine and sun dried on raised beds adjacent to the wet mill. Leaving that fruit mucilage intact instead of washing it away is the hallmark of honey process coffee. This lot, however, is what some call "semi-washed", or "white honey", which is the Costa Rican equivalent of a fully washed coffee. The demucilager machine is calibrated to remove as much fruit as possible. Then the coffee is soaked for a short period to help wash away some of the remaining fruit. Without fermentation, there is still a very thin layer of fruit intact. This means the coffee looks a little darker when roasting it, and a much higher instance of chaff than the typical fully washed/fermented coffee.	Farm Gate	This lot from Monte Brisas is a balanced coffee with a nuanced side that adds a bit of interest to the cup profile (especially the light roasts). A scent of caramelized sugar and toasted marshmallow melded well together in the dry fragrance of the City roast, with accents of butter rum Life Savers, and cocoa. The crust on the light roast demonstrated more of the butterscotch type sweetness, flanked by hints of citrus, brown sugar, and a raisin note in the steam. The cup has a very clean profile with raw sugar notes at the core, accented by milder fruit hints, lightly spiced, and brisk acidity. Hints of fresh apple and lemon tea add to this coffee's vibrant side, and lead to a mouth-cleansing finish. This coffee has a creaminess in texture regardless of roast level, though bolstered quite a bit at Full City and Full City+. Dark roasts bring about rich bittersweet chocolate flavors, with wisps of toffee almond, cinnamon-laced cocoa powder, and a sweet smokey note in the finish. This lot from Monte Brisas is an approachable coffee, with a little something extra in the light roasts, and well suited for dark roasted espresso too.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/costa-rica-zarcero-monte-brisas-7995.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:48
246	East Africa Nya-Nye SWP Decaf	88	October 2024 Arrival	Nyeri, Kenya and Nyamasheke, Rwanda	Wet Process, then SWP Decaf	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City	116	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	SL-28, SL-34, Ruiru 11, Bourbon	AB (Kenya), and A1 (Rwanda)	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Impressive flavor profiles, bittersweet aspects of toasted caramel, flashes of vibrant citrus, lemon squares, hints of fruit and spices, dark cocoa roast tones, and chocolate stout beer. City to Full City. Good for espresso.	We've chosen to name this coffee, "Nya-Nye", due to the fact that it's a blend of coffee from Nyamasheke, Rwanda, and Nyeri, Kenya. In fact. 2/3 of this blend is Kenyan AB coffee, which is a big part of this coffee's interesting bright side. Rwandan coffee is no slouch in the acidity department either, but its Kenya that's known for high-toned flavors, and helps bring very appealing citrus flavors to this unique tasting decaf. All of the coffees that went into this blend were complex in their own way, and sweeter-than-average, which in our experience makes them great candidates for decaffeination. This lot was decaffeinated at the Swiss Water plant in Vancouver, Canada, who use only water to remove 99.9% of the caffeine content from coffee. The process is thought to be more gentle than some others that use chemical solvents, and we definitely see a difference in the cup flavors. Roasting decaf can be a little tricky since the color of the beans are already a shade of brown. It's also the case that the beans suffer some degradation from the decaffeination process and so oils tend to rise to the surface more easily, even when roasted to City+. For home roasters, if your roaster has manual heat control, try taking a slower approach to avoid a violent 1st crack and so that it doesn't get away from you. In a popper you can try overloading the batch size which should help to slow roast progression down some. Learn more about the Swiss Water Decaf method here.	Farm Gate, Decaf	The dry fragrance at City roast level has a chocolate wafer cookie smell and molasses, with hints of spice and stewed fruits. The wet aroma brought out a creamy-sweet honey butter note, with caramelized sugars, sweet breads like cinnamon roll, and raisin. The hot coffee has the bittering and sweet aspects of burned caramel up front, with roast tone close behind. The acidity level is pretty remarkable for decaf coffee too, especially when roasted light. But you can also roll off the high tones by roasting to Full City too, simultaneously dialing up body and bittersweet roast flavors. My City roast had flashes of vibrant citrus that brought to mind lemon squares. There's a juicy quality too, pulling out some of the fruited hints, like apple, peach, and berry. Dark cocoa notes are out in full force at Full City, with an unrefined molasses note underneath, and a chocolate stout flavor in the finish that has staying power. Full City roasts will work really well as a bittersweet, and chocolatey espresso. I would keep from hitting 2nd crack, as decafs tend to be susceptible to charring if roasted too dark.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/nya-nye-east-africa-swp-decaf-8124.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:52

Caramel, pistachio torrone, lemongrass, and roasted barley green tea, and chocolate confections. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Castillo is a hybrid coffee that was developed in Colombia for high yields, and resistance to coffee diseases like leaf rust. It often gets a bad rap, especially when compared to one of its parents, Caturra. The truth is, Castillo has the potential to be a very interesting cup in its own right. It often carries herbal characteristics, and in this case, dense bittersweet notes that work well at a range of roasts. We were impressed by this lot, but will let you be the judge. The 120 manzana Finca Miravalles is a family affair, owned by husband and wife Luis Duarte and Tete Chacón, and much of the management is handled by their son, Luis Jr. The farm is located in Apaneca, Ahuachapan, not too far from the Santa Ana volcano. It used to be two separate farms, Miravalles belonging to Tete's family, Santa Maria to Luis's. They were both raised on these neighboring farms, family ownership going back some 150 years. Sometime after marrying, they put in an offer on Miravalles, which was all but abandoned at the time, and joined with Santa Maria under the Miravalles name. They have been renovating the farm ever since, keeping much of the original Bourbon and Pacas cultivars, and planting several other varieties too. They've done an amazing job segregating the cultivars in separate plots, and go to great lenghts to harvest and process separately too. Miravalles is perched on the verdant slopes of the Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain region, and spans an altitude range of about 1250 to 1550 meters above sea level. Check out our video tour of the Miravalles farm, and in-depth look at their wet process method in action at their mill.	Farm Gate	City+ is a good starting roast point, where bittersweet flavors balance out accents of savory nut and interesting green herbal notes. The sweetness in the dry fragrance has some cocoa and almond. The wet aroma has a complex herbal sweetness that reminded me of Manuka honey, with dark chocolate brownie notes when breaking the crust. The cup presents some herbal accents too, as well as raw sugars, and some forward-facing nutty tones. City+ roasts yield flavor profiles of almond torrone, caramel, lemongrass, and roasted barley tea. Full City roasts have flavors of chewy chocolate confections, like dark chocolate coconut bar, and 80%+ dark cacao bar. Pulling an espresso shot of my Full City roast with 3 days rest brought out chocolate-forward flavors with the creamy richness of dark truffles, and a really nice lemon-sage hint.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/el-salvador-atiquizaya-castillo-7959.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:55
248	El Salvador Dry Process Finca San Luis	87	July 2024 Arrival	Concepción de Ataco, Ahuachapan	Dry Process (Natural)	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	35	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Centroamericano H1	SHB EP	.6 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Intense cup flavors are hard to miss, rustic fruits, pungent burnt sugars, blackberry, winey plum, honey mead, chocolate-covered date, earthy beet sugar, macadamia nut, and pleasantly bittersweet aftertaste. City to Full City+.	Finca San Luis is owned by Luis Duarte, and is located in Ataco, Ahuachapan, not too far from the Santa Ana volcano. San Luis spans roughly 25 well-shaded hectares of land, across an altitude range of 1280 - 1400 meters above sea level. The farm is actually made up of several different "blocks" in close proximity to each other, though not necessarily connected. The Duarte family has chosen to plant their farm heavily in Bourbon cultivar, a tradition going back more than 50 years. But they also have small plots with other varieties too that are picked and processed separately. Last year's dry process lot from San Luis was only 6 bags. I'm happy to report that this year the Duarte's put together a 40 bag lot for us, selecting the same H1 hybrid that was used last year, referred to as "Centroamericano" locally. This compact, dwarf coffee plant is a cross of Sarchimor and the Ethiopian heirloom, Rume Sudan. One of the first things we noticed at their farms and mill is how incredible cherry selection is.While variety certainly impacts cup flavors, dry processing plays the biggest role here. Tasting it amongst the other washed coffees from Duarte's farms, the fruit-forward cup flavors were hard to miss, making it impossible for us to pass up! Don't expect the floral fruit of a dry process Ethiopian coffee. But rather, rustic fruits that display winey aromatics, as well as juicy undertones, and impressive bittersweetness to boot. A lot of hand sorting of unripe coffee and defects is employed before the cherry is even delivered to the mill. The coffee is then dried on raised beds for 15-20 days. Check out our video tour of Finca San Luis from earlier in 2023.	Farm Gate	This is a coffee for lovers of dry process coffees, with wild fruits, and pulpy fermented flavors that are intense and hard to miss. The dry fragrance comes off a little like anaerobic coffee, with berry fruits that point to red wine, and berry balsamic reduction. The sweetness is intense in the wet aroma, fruit and berry at the forefront, with rustic overtones. The cup has pungent burnt sugar sweetness that helps support some of the fruitier top notes that never seemed to let up in either of our roasts (City+ and Full City). The fruit flavors at the front of the cup brought to mind blackberry pancake syrup, winey plum, as well as notes of honey mead, and earthy beet sugar. Not all of the flavors come with fermented aromatics, and I also pick up on notes of chocolate-covered date, and macadamia nut. The texture is medium-bodied, which lends to some lingering fruits in the finish that are rounded off by pleasant bittersweet roast tones.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/el-salvador-dry-process-finca-san-luis-7965.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:37:59

It's owned by husband and wife Luis Duarte and Tete Chacón, and much of the management is handled by their son, Luis Jr, and Chico, the on-site manager of 15 years. The farm is located in Apaneca, Ahuachapan, not too far from the Santa Ana volcano. It used to be two separate farms, Miravalles belonging to Tete's family, Santa Maria to Luis's. They were both raised on these neighboring farms, family ownership going back some 150 years. Sometime after marrying, they put in an offer on Miravalles, which was all but abandoned at the time, and joined with Santa Maria under the Miravalles name. They have been renovating the farm ever since, keeping much of the original Bourbon and Pacas cultivars, and planting several other varieties, including H1 and F1 hybrids, Catimor, Pacamara, Caturra, and Gesha. They've done an amazing job segregating the cultivars in separate plots, and go to great lenghts to harvest and process separately too. This year we bought several of the varietal separations, this being an all Bourbon lot. Miravalles is perched on the verdant slopes of the Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain region, and spans an altitude range of about 1250 to 1550 meters above sea level. Check out our video tour of the Miravalles farm, and in-depth look at their wet process method in action at their mill.	Farm Gate	City+ is a good starting point for this coffee where bittering chocolate is matched up with well-developed sweetness and inky body. The dry fragrance has notes of browned sugar, and honey wheat, and the wet aroma brings out some candied nuts and cocoa. There's a convergence of chocolate roast tones and brown sugars that will hold up to quite a dark roast level, and intensifies with deeper development. Our lighter-middle roasts are very well-rounded (City+/Full City), with layers of cocoa, toasted sugars, and nutty accents of walnut and hazelnut marked the aftertaste. The cup flavors are well-balanced, and top notes, while limited, bring up some subtle spice/herbal hints in the finish. As espresso, expect layers of cocoa and creamy nut flavors to make a lasting impression. Miravalles Bourbon is an excellent option for milk drinks whether as espresso, or brewed coffee with cream.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/el-salvador-finca-miravalles-bourbon-7960.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:02

A very friendly dark roast Ethiopian candidate too! City to Full City+. Good Ethiopian espresso.	Geta Bore is a cooperative in Ethiopia's Illubabor region, Bore Woreda to be exact, not far from Agaro. The cooperative falls under a larger umbrella "Union" that includes other Western coops we buy from like Duromina, Nano and Genji Challa, Yukiro and more.  Being a cooperative, it is member-owned and leadership and decision making are a group-effort on the part of the member base. The Union provides the coops under their umbrella with agronomical and business assistance, and most importantly, marketing and export services to get the coffee into the hands of international buyers. They also rolled out an organic certification program several years back, though this lot was not brought in as certified. The processing site sits at 2000 meters above sea level, and members farm coffee as high as 2200 meters. We found that this lot of Geta Bore excels at a wide range of roasts. The coffee shows nice acidic impressions when kept to light roast levels. Balanced sweetness and bittering chocolate roast flavors find harmony with fruited top notes at Full City.	Farm Gate	Geta Bore is such a delicious brewed coffee that offers fragrant sweetness, and syrupy stone fruit accent notes. That stone fruit essence is something we note in a lot of the Western cooperative coffee, an aspect that seems to be unique, if not common to certain Oromia regions. The fragrance and aroma are marked by notes of honey laced with cinnamon stick, fragrant black tea, and tangy apricot accents. The wet aroma has lovely sweetness of honey, baked peach, and tenedam/rue herbs that are both fragrant and sweet. The cup is complex, sweet at its core, with top notes that intensify as the coffee cools. City roast is not too light for this coffee, and produces dynamic fruits that touch on tangy orange, peach, and a hint of cherry drink powder (think Kool Aid). Cup sweetness helps balance out the brighter high tones, along with a shade of rustic cocoa in the background. Working through the cup, our list of top notes included apricot preserves, peach tea, and complex masala spice mix. Don't be afraid to go dark with this one too. My Full City+ roast wasn't too bittersweet at all, and offered a dried mango note, and dark berry chocolate truffles. Dark roasts make an excellent Ethiopian espresso.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-agaro-geta-bore-8061.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:05

Dried blueberry and apricot, marmalade spreads, peach preserves, black forest cake, lime peel, soft florals, herbal accents of rue and shiso. City to Full City.	Dambi Uddo is the name of the town where this coffee is from, procured, and then processed at a privately run mill in Woreda Odo Shakiso, Western Guji. Elevation at the farms they buy cherry from range from 1850 to 2200 meters above sea level. Each lot they produce is made up of coffee from hundreds of different farmers in the region, most with only a few hundred coffee trees or less. You tend to see coffee intercropped with other fruits and vegetables, "false banana" being one the more common food staples to see planted in the region. The false banana plant has many uses, and is widely utilized for its starchy inners that are often fermented with yeast to make a bread ("kocho"), and the leaves can be transformed into roofs for houses, baskets, and more. Dry processing is the oldest coffee processing method still used, and involves drying the coffee bean and cherry whole. It's not as simple as casually drying full cherries, and the best lots take a lot of preparation! The coffee has to be spread out to a layer depth of only a few centimeters, no more, in order to allow air flow. The coffee is turned hourly, or even more frequently, in order to facilitate even drying and keep the coffee from molding. It's not difficult, but requires constant attention. Workers continually pull out lower quality coffee in the form of physical defects and coffee that was not harvested at peak ripeness in order to cultivate Grade 1 quality.	Farm Gate	Fruit-forward and flavorful, this dry process lot from Dambi Uddo town pulls out fruit and berry flavors and a layer of chocolate that is easily enhanced with roast. I picked up on very nice berry tones in the profile, from dry fragrance all the way through the cup. I found it to be aromatic at times, especially in the light roasts, and a bit more jammy as you approach City+/Full City. The ground coffee smelled intensely sweet, with notes of dried berries, peach, and an aromatic dark honey note. Pouring hot water on the ground coffee stirred up enticing smells of chocolate-dipped fruits laced with a soft floral accent, cooked plum, and more of an intense cocoa roast profile in my Full City roast. Brewing a City roast produced convincing fruit flavors that at first came off like dehydrated blueberries, and natural dried apricots, shifting to brighter notes of marmalade-like fruit spreads, peach preserves, and lime peel. As the coffee cooled, a floral aroma brought out a really nice 'ripe' quality in the flavors of fruits and berries. The coffee has moderate acidity for a natural, though pretty well-rounded off at Full City. Dark roasts add a delicious chocolate overlay to a still fruited flavor profile, enhancing bass notes and jammy flavors, with aspects of black forest cake. The cup aroma had an interesting herbal accent, like fresh shiso leaf. Though Dambi Uddo is right up my alley for a dry process espresso, it's not for the faint of heart, so I'm withholding an "official" recommendation.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-dry-process-buno-dambi-uddo-8041.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:09

Notes of blueberry and blackberry have juicy brightness, accented by flavors of melon, cascara tea, hints of rose water and fresh herbs. City to Full City.	The lot was processed at a privately owned coffee mill called "Tuku", not far from Gerba town, Guji Zone. It's named after the owner (green jacket, third photo), who is working with a local exporter as a vertically integrated entity. In this case, the exporter affords Tuku financing to buy cherries during the harvest season, and a link to the market. The processing site sits at 2125 meters above sea level, and some of the farms they buy from are even higher elevation. The dry process method is the oldest way of processing whole coffee cherries down to the green seeds we roast, and is a big part of why coffees like Tuku taste so fruity. It takes a lot longer to dry whole coffee cherries down to the standard of 10-11% moisture, and during that time a fermentation occurs within. Not only are dry process coffees often fruit-forward, they also produce a lot more chaff than fully washed ("wet process"). Just be aware of it and be sure to vacuum your roaster between batches, especially for those with open heating elements, like a Behmor. Speaking of which, we're seeing some pretty small beans in this lot, thankfully not so small that you need to worry about roasting in your Behmor. We tested 200 grams of coffee, and only had a couple beans slip through the grid.	Farm Gate	Light roasts of Guji Tuku brewed a very impressive cup, with an interplay of complex fruits and delicate aromatics. The ground coffee had a sweet smell of dark honey, pancake syrup, dehydrated berries, melon, and frankincense. The wet aroma smelled just as incredible. My light City roast (1:30 post 1st Crack) had a scent of floral blueberry, whole clove, honey, and Chai tea. The cup flavors are bright and delicious, and flavor profiles at the City level are as intensely fruited as they are delicate and aromatic. Layers of fruit unfold to reveal notes of juicy blueberry and blackberry, ripe green melon, and coffee fruit ("cascara") tea. The cup offers impressive acidity when roasted light that gives the fruity cup profile a sturdy structure. For dry process coffee, it has a lot of the floral and fragrant flavors that you expect from washed Ethiopian coffee, like hints of jasmine, and rose water. City+ roasts had a complex note of pomegranate syrup, along with fresh herbal notes of rue, and coriander. I did not roast this coffee darker, but would not hesitate to go as dark as Full City if you're looking for a fruited dark roast.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-dry-process-guji-tuku-8103.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:12
253	Ethiopia Dry Process Hambela Goro	92	August 2024 Arrival	Kebele Goro Badessa, Woreda Hambela Wamena	Dry Process (Natural)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City	100	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Heirloom Varietals	Grade 1	.6 d/300gr, 14-17 Screen	Intensely aromatic dry process Guji saturated with fruited sweetness, jammy notes of mixed berries and plum, accents of fragrant floral and rue notes, bittering spices, dried blueberry, and sorghum syrup. City to Full City.	The coffee comes from small holder coffee farmers in the Goro Badessa Woreda of Hambela Wamena, a high altitude region that tops out well over 2100 meters above sea level. In fact, this particular Goro site sits at a staggering 2335 meters, which is very high, even by Ethiopian standards! Goro produces mostly dry process coffee, but does do small amounts of wet process too when they have the cash flow to buy more cherries. Most of the actual coffee drying happens at auxiliary sites nearby, where they also facilitate cherry buying in surrounding villages. This coffee underwent several layers of hand picking from the whole coffee cherry to the final milled green coffee in order to achieve "Grade 1" status. These lots are made up of coffee from several hundred different farmers, most with only a couple hundred coffee trees or less. You tend to see coffee intercropped with other fruits and vegetables, "false banana" being one the more common food staples to see planted in the Hambela region. The false banana plant has many uses, and is widely utilized for its starchy inners that are often fermented with yeast to make a bread ("kocho"), and the leaves can be transformed into roofs for houses, baskets, and more.	Farm Gate	Goro presents potent aromatics and intense characteristics in light to middle roasts, exactly what we hope for from dry process Guji! The dry fragrance is peppered with berry notes, both dried and cooked, accented by hints of rustic sugars, and complex aromatic notes of spices and fresh herbs. The berry aspects really came through in the wet aroma, blackberry jam, along with saturated sweetness that reminded me of blueberry pie filling, and an enticing herbal overlay. The herbal aroma really comes through in the cup loud and clear in the cup too, especially at City roast level where the brewed coffee has a strong aroma of rue herbs, along with floral accents to more subtle effect. Light roasts have a pleasant tartness to the fruited flavor profile, which lends an acidic impression to the cup flavors, an oft missing element in dry process coffees. Top notes included jammy hints of mixed berries, and plum. There's an interesting spice-bittering note that comes through in the finish, like clove and cinnamon, adding a bit more complexity to the aromatic profile. Overall, the cup flavors come off well-defined for a dry process coffee, though not without rustic elements that are common to the process method. In Goro, those come across like rustic sweeteners, such as sorghum syrup, and palm sugar. Full City roasts have impressive body and flavor, a dense tactile appeal blends nicely with aromatic fruit flavors, like dark chocolate-covered blueberries.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-dry-process-hambela-goro-8039.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:16
254	Ethiopia Dry Process Korate	92	August 2024 Arrival	Korate Village, Dari Kidame, Guji	Dry Process (Natural)	Raised Bed Sun Dried	City to Full City	60	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Heirloom Cultivars	Grade 1	.4 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Floral and spice aromatics bring a refined aspect to heavier-handed fruits. Strawberry, peach jelly, orange spice tea, rose, cardamom spice, and a lime peel hint mingle with sharp bittersweetness in the finish. City to Full City.	This lot was processed at a privately run coffee processing site called Korate (also the name of the village), very near to Dari Kidame area, in Western Guji. The farmers who deliver to the Korate mill have coffee planted in high altitude zones nearby that span a range of 1900 - 2100 meters above sea level. They only produce dry processed coffees at this site ("naturals"), and with a capacity of up to 2 shipping containers a season (roughly 80k # of green coffee). That's a lot of coffee, however, it's actually on the small side for Ethiopia! The mill has registered more than 116 small farmers in total from the villages bordering the site, most with an average farm size of 2 hectares of coffee or less. Farmers are paid a higher rate for delivering only ripe cherries, which means less hand labor at the drying beds, and ultimately, a cleaner sorted coffee. Mill workers also mitigate unripe coffee by "floating" the coffee cherries in water. Generally, unripe coffee floats while the ripe coffee sinks. This makes removal quite easy, and a first step in grading. The coffee is then moved to raised drying beds for around 3 to 4 weeks time, until dried to around 11% moisture content.	Farm Gate	There are so many different flavors to be found in this stunning dry process coffee from Korate, with fruit profiles that carry vivid brightness when roasted light, and perfumed floral hints that bring a refined quality to the heavy-handed fruity notes. There's a very clean sweetness in the dry fragrance, and berry-fruit accents add depth to the profile. Notes of fragrant raw sugars, strawberry jam, and chocolate milk powder popped up in our City roast. The wet aroma smelled of chocolate-dipped berries, and a beautiful floral overlay was raised in the steam. Korate is definitely of the cleaner variety of dry process Ethiopia, and one I've really enjoyed sitting with and observing the shifting flavor profiles as it cools. The cup is moderately bright for dry process, and floral too. Flavors of tannic tea and raw sugars are accented by red berry and stone fruit, and a floral rose note brings a nice level of complexity to the aroma. The fruited accents that immediately come into play pointed to ripe strawberry, orange spice tea, and peach jelly. I'm happy to report that the fruited sweetness stands up to the deeper low tones of a dark roast, so Full City gets the green light. Dark toned cocoa flavors are impacted by hints of blackberry tea, cardamom spice, and a fragrant lime note in the nose that mingles with the sharply bittersweet aftertaste. Perfect for pour over brewing at both roast levels.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-dry-process-korate-8042.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:19
255	Ethiopia Dry Process Senna Katta Mountain	90	October 2024 Arrival	Limmu Kossa, Jimma	Dry Process (Natural)	Raised Bed Sun Dried	City to Full City+	158	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Heirloom Cultivars	Grade 1	.9 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Tasty Limu natural, natural dried apricot, canned peach, honey, yellow tea, and aromatic cedar. Standout espresso option too, viscous body, and a flavor profile of chocolate-covered plum. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Senna Katta Mountain  farm is located in the Boter forest preserve, Limu Kossa, Jimma. It's actually the only coffee farm in this remote forest area, and the small clearing made for their processing site is pretty easy to spot on an areal map amidst the surrounding sea of green! This isn't a clear cut coffee farm, but rather, part of a government land grant where plots in agro forest areas were given away to farmers who could be good stewards to the land by maintaining the natural forest habitat. Senna Katta Mountain is owned by wife and husband Yodit, and Solomon. They are both pharmacists who met when opening a clinic in Limu Kossa sometime ago. Yodit's father was an agronomist in Jimma, working for the government, and it was their dream to build a farm in the area. With his help as their advisor, they did just that, stepping in as owners after the original owner was unable to keep up with the land improvements that were required. Senna Katta Mountain is 130 hectares in size, though only 110 hectares are under production. It's considered semi-forest coffee since it's not wild coffee, but still grows beneath the preserved forest canopy overhead. This is a very high elevation zone, the mill at 2300 meters with coffee growing even a little higher. Because of this, the coffee comes a bit later than most other areas we buy from.	Farm Gate	Limu coffees can be quite different than those from Yirga Cheffe and Guji, and the dry process method adds a layer of unique fruits, too. The dry fragrance has fruit pastry-like sweetness, with accents cinnamon roll and raisin, stone fruit Danish, and molasses. The wet aroma brings out a really nice cooked sugar sweetness, and more defined notes of dried papaya, with honey granola. The fruits seem a little muddled when the cup is piping hot, but open up to more discernible flavors as you sit with it. At City roast level, I picked up on some really nice stone fruit and aromatic honey notes. The flavors carried a rustic element of natural dehydrated fruits, like the brown apricots, and salted plum. The cup sweetness had a palm sugar note that played off earthy hints of yellow tea, and cedar (like opening a cedar chest), and the cooling cup offered a tangy flavor profile of canned peaches. Dark roasts showed impressive chocolate flavors and viscous, inky body, along with a winey plum note. This is another dry process Ethiopia I am thoroughly enjoying as espresso, where dark roast tones bring together bittersweet chocolate and dark stone fruits for a flavor profile of chocolate-covered dried plums.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-dry-process-senna-katta-mountain-8123.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:23
256	Ethiopia Guji Hambela Dabaye	91	July 2024 Arrival	Dame Dabaye, Hambela Wamena, Guji	Wet Process (Washed)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to City+	60	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Heirloom Cultivars	Grade 1	.2 d/300gr, 14-16 Screen	Light roasts are impressively sweet as pour over, blossoming with aromatic floral notes and lively acidity. Notes of jasmine, cane sugar, honey, lemonade, mango and strawberry candy. City to City+.	Hambela Dabaye is from longtime Guji coffee farmer and mill manager, Kedir Hassan. He is the older brother to Esmael Hassan, who you may remember as the producer of another Guji coffee we've also carried, Kayon Mountain. "Dabaye" is the name of the kebele where this Hambela station is located (a town, more or less). We were lucky enough to be hosted at this station on our December 2018 visit, camping out in a pair of military tents replete with cots, overlooking the couple hundred drying tables below us. Kedir is an incredibly proficient and capable engineer as well as coffee farmer, and built the entire Hambela station in one season. You wouldn't know this, as it's visually apparent everything was built with high processing standards, and with efficiency in mind. Of course he did not complete Hambela on his own, and thanks to his long standing connection with the the people in this area, he had much needed community support. Hambela sits at 1816 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown as high as 2100 meters. They mostly buy coffee from farmers in the surrounding kebeles of Buliye, Wamena, Borticha, Dari Rogicha and Dabaye, of course.	Farm Gate	Delicious and delicate, this wet-processed lot from Hambela Dabaye packs impressive sweetness, and blossoms with Guji floral cup characteristics. The dry fragrance smelled of tea-like and floral accents, with notes of white frosting, and peach. A more intense sweetness emerges from the wetted grounds, and running my spoon through the coffee crust released a potent mix of partially raw sugars, fresh flowers, and a crystalized ginger. In the cup, City roasts produce a potent floral aroma propped up by resolute sweetness of cane sugar, and accent of white honey. As the coffee cools down some, I pick up on more fruited flavors like lemonade, fresh mango, and a strawberry Starburst candy note. It's really a special coffee, lively and bright flavors are refreshing, and the complex aromatics of jasmine put it up there with some of our top washed Guji's this season. So much of the coffee character can be described as light and delicate, and you should give it a light treatment in the roaster too. Pulling 1 minute and 30 seconds after the start of 1st Crack is not too soon! The coffee coloring might look slightly uneven, with some chaff still intact to the seed. But that's where I stopped my favorite of the two roasts I performed and I've been enjoying the most amazing pour over brews.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-guji-hambela-dabaye-7996.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:27
257	Ethiopia Mirabawi Buna SWP Decaf	89	July 2024 Arrival	Kafa and Limu, Western Ethiopia	Dry Process and Wet Process coffees, then Swiss Water Process Decaf	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City	112	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Heirloom Cultivars	Grade 1	.4 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Complex decaf coffee that's fruited, aromatic, and undeniably Ethiopian! Sweet profiles of simmering berries, plum jam, apple, and even a tropical/floral hint of passionfruit juice. City to Full City. Good for espresso.	We just got this delicious Ethiopian decaf back from being processed at Swiss Water in Vancouver, Canada, and are amazed by how it's tasting! It helps that it's made up from coffees that we loved before being decaffeinated, and consisted of 2/3 dry process, 1/3 wet process. Including fruited dry process coffees in the mix has been a key ingredient of most of our Ethiopian decaf recipes, and a big part of why they come back tasting so nice. It's no secret that all decaffeination processes are hard on the coffee, and tend to flatten out some of the more nuanced cup flavors. But with fruit-forward dry process coffees, the process merely softens some of those heavy-handed flavors. This is one of the reasons we love working with Swiss; it allows us to send high quality coffee from our own stocks, and affords us a level of control where we can customize blends to our own taste. This lot is mostly made up of coffees from Ethiopia's Western Jimma region. The bulk of it is split between two larger scale farms run by Dehab Mesfin, near the Bonga forest in Kafa, and Senna Katta Mountain farm, in Limu's Boter forest reserve. Swiss Water Decaf decaf use their patented chemical-free, water-decaffeination process to remove 99.9% of the coffee's caffeine content. The technique is gentle on the coffee's organic structure, leaving much of the aromatic compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. Read more about the Swiss Water technique here.	Farm Gate, Decaf	When this latest Ethiopian decaf was returned to us after being processed, we were pretty floored by the cup quality. Tasting it alongside the rest of our decaf arrivals (which are all very nice, btw!) the cup flavors tasted dramatically different; complex, fruited, aromatic, and undeniably Ethiopian! Context plays a large role in this perception, so I don't want to overpromise here. But as far as decafs go, the aromatic qualities make it stand out from the pack, and will likely fly under the radar as being decaf at all. The dry fragrance gives off dried fruit, like raisin and prune, with aromatic sugars and berries. The wet aroma had more intense fruited characteristics that skewed to the 'winey' side, accented by dark spice notes. Mirabawi Buna is a very sweet brewed coffee, and origin flavors become easier to pinpoint the longer you sip it. Light roasts are where I get the most fruited character, as well as a surprisingly moderate level of acidity. The flavor profiles profiles hinted at simmering berries, plum jam, apple, and even a tropical/floral hint of passionfruit juice. There are some faint wheaty/decaf notes in the finish, but they're hardly the focus. We've had great luck using previous versions of this decaf as espresso when roasted to Full City. It's also a very nice option to use as 1:1 Moka Java blend in conjunction with our current Indonesia "Nusantara" decaf from Swiss. Pre-roast blending works really well, but it can also be fun to roast them separately and try blending a melange of ratios and roast levels to fine tune the flavor profile.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-mirabawi-buna-swp-decaf-7982.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:30
258	Ethiopia Shakiso Wesi	91	July 2024 Arrival	Wesi, Shakiso	Wet Process (Washed)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to City+	80	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Heirloom Cultivars	Grade 1	.2 d/300gr, 14+ Screen	Clean cup sweetness, snappy acidity, with floral aromatics that tie in nicely to the sweet flavors. Black tea, lemon spritz, Bergamot, lemongrass, lavender, rose water, coriander, citrus bitters, and ginger bread cookie. City to City+.	You may remember the Kayon Mountain name from our previous Ethiopian coffee lineups. Kayon Mountain is owned and operated by the family of Esmael Hassen, located in the southern Guji zone of Shakiso. They run a large family estate, and also operate several coffee processing sites in Guji towns, like Wesi. This newer wet mill sits at 2178 meters above sea level, and is processing both wet and dry process coffee. This is one of their fully washed, wet process lots, and it shined when cup testing Kayon coffees early in the harvest season. The coffee is pulped on a McKinnon-type, disc pulper that uses friction discs to remove the outer cherry and much of the fruit from the green coffee seeds. The mucilage-covered coffee is then fermented overnight in cement tanks, before being washed with clean water, and dried on raised drying beds. During the process, the coffee is hand-picked several times to remove coffee with physical defects, or that is not ripe. Wet process coffee takes about two weeks to dry. The gentleman photographed in the maroon shirt is the manager, Tariko. I found the coffee screen size to be a little on the small size, which is typical for Ethiopia, but not so small that it slipped through the smaller-grid Behmor drum.	Farm Gate	Shakiso Wesi delivers clean cup sweetness, and bright citrus character, with floral aromatics that tie in nicely to the sweet flavors. The dry fragrance had a scent of fragrant sugars, aromatic caramels, butter frosting with a hint of vanilla, along with a note of peach scones. Pouring the hot water on the grounds brought out potent brown sugar notes, such as raw panela and rapadura, honey butter, and floral accents. At City roast level, the cup flavors are clean and bright, backed by convincing sweetness that keeps the profile feeling centered, and well-balanced. Snappy bright notes hint at black tea with fresh lemon juice, lemongrass herbal hints, and aromatic Bergamot. Floral and aromatic notes have a mild, but persistent presence, and push through as the coffee cools with intimations of lavender, rose water, Botan rice candy, and some fresh lemon balm. Light roasts have exceptional cup clarity that shines when brewed as pour-over. The finish is marked by notes of coriander spice, citrus bitters, and ginger bread cookie. I recommend sticking to City - City+ roast range, in order to bring out acidity and aromatic highlights. I roasted on batch to Full City and found that it was more roast tone than I'd like to taste in a washed Guji coffee.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-shakiso-wesi-8000.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:38:33

Full City shows brooding cocoa-roast tones and dark fruit hints. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Pulcal is an old coffee estate overlooking the colonial city of Antigua, and is situated at a range of 6000 feet in altitude. The farm dates to early colonial times (check out the neat tile crest in the first photo below), but coffee was planted in the late 1800's and first exported in 1918. The farm is said to have a unique micro-climate in the Antigua valley, as well as hillside exposure and well-draining soils. "Inteligente" refers to a specific block of the farm, planted in old Typica and Bourbon cultivar trees. It's all the way at the top and has the best sun exposure and ideal topography. Being at the highest point on the farm, the coffee from Inteligente ripens a little later than the rest. To form this lot, we cupped several small "day lots" (coffee lots that are kept separate by each delivery day), selecting those that had the best sweetness and brightness. The coffee is processed at the Bella Vista mill nearby. It's fully washed using their water conserving depulpers, and then dried in the indoor drying rooms on raised beds.	Farm Gate	Pulcal Inteligente is a sweet and balanced coffee, with subtle top-note complexity that always makes it a real highlight in the lineup of Central American coffees. The dry fragrance shows strength in raw sugar sweetness, along with a very nice tea leaf note, and hint of raisin. We found roasts beyond City+ see a boost in sweetness in the aroma that billowed from the steam of the wetted grounds. When hot, the brewed coffee shows depth of sweetness, ribbons of cane sugar juice, caramel, a dash of brown sugar, and delicate hints of herbal tea and spice. The coffee cools to flavor notes of toasted sugar, pear butter, and elegant apple-like acidity. Full City roasts bring out the bittersweet chocolate flavors, like high % cacao chocolate bar with roasted nibs, and a faint hint of dark fruit. Pulcal brews very well, a real crowd-pleasing coffee, that also doubles wonderfully as a single origin espresso ("SO"). Full City shots produce incredibly viscous mouthfeel, dense dark chocolate flavors are accented by a spark of lemon, and a dark fruit tone in the background that adds interest.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-antigua-pulcal-inteligente-2-8110.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:39:47

Caramel, chocolate-dipped almond, dried apple, and Cola. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	The Chichupak cooperative is located in a village of the same name, taking its name from a plant native to the region that is used to make soap ("Chupak" means "soap"). This area of Baja Verapaz is home to an indigenous community of subsistance farmers, coffee being the primary crop. This tight knit group of farmers formed an a cooperative alliance in the early 1980's, banding together resources to build a communal coffee processing site, complete with wet mill, fermentation tanks, raised drying beds and patio space. Chichupak is almost smack dab in the middle of Guatemala, not a region we've bought from historically. The climate and altitude are favorable to growing coffee, the latter spanning a range of 1600 to 2000 meters above sea level. We found this lot from Chichupak to have impressive balance at a wide range of roasts, along with fruited accents, and moderate fruited brightness. Not only is it versatile in roast application, but it excelled as both brewed coffee and espresso too. We haven't visited the coop, and the photos in this review are from various other trips to Guatemalan coffee farms.	\N	This coffee has a "classic" Central American cup profile in a lot of ways; clean flavors, moderately sweet, big bodied, and low-toned with roast development. The fragrance offered succinct bittersweetness, brown sugar, and an Umami note like sesame snacks. When pouring hot water on the grounds a pleasantly caramelized note comes up in the steam, along with a scent of semi-sweet chocolate chips. In our assessment, the coffees of Chichupak have been very versatile in the roaster, and brew up well balanced, approachable flavors. City roasts had caramel notes, with mild accents of dried apple and almond, and a Cola note in the finish. My Full City roast had more intense roast tones and chocolate bittersweets, with a flavor profile of roasted almonds dipped in dark chocolate. As espresso, this is an A-plus! My Full City shot did have a bit of a citrus bite, though tempered by bittersweet flavors, and syrupy texture.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-coban-chichupak-coop-8128.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:39:50
262	Guatemala Dry Process Finca Rosma	88	September 2024 Arrival	Michicoy, San Pedro Necta, Huehuetenango	Dry Process (Natural)	Covered Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	10	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon, Caturra, Catuai, Typica	SHB EP	.6 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Wild and woolly dry process flavor profiles that hint at blackberry wine, dried apple, prune, dried mango, and fruit liqueurs. A weighty bodied cup at both ends of the roast spectrum, with substantial bittersweetness. City to Full City+.	Finca Rosma is a small farm near Michicoy town in San Pedro Necta area of Huehuetenango, and is owned by the Morales family, managed by the son Fredy. The name is in honor of his grandmother, Rosemarie. It's located on a high ridge where you drive in to the farm at nearly 1900 meters above sea level, then descend down to the mill at around 1600 meters. When Alejandro Rosales bought the farm in 1963, the only way to get there was by foot, or horseback. It's not that easy of a trek by road, either. The farm is quite steep, typical for the high ridges of the Sierra Los Cuchumatanes mountains. These days Alejandro's son, Fredy, plays an outsized role at Finca Rosma, and has been our connection to the farm since we started buying it more than a decade ago (it's worth noting that Fredy is also the linchpin in our Proyecto Xinabajul buying project in Huehue). The plantings to be quite a jumble of cultivars, also typical for the region. There are certainly a lot of old Bourbon and Typica (Arabigo) trees, and some Caturra and Catuai as well. There are also red and yellow varieties. They mainly produce wet-process coffee at Rosma using traditional fermentation methods, but they also produce smaller amounts of dry process coffees too in small batches (aka "naturals"). Whereas the wet process method involves removing the cherry before drying, the dry process method keeps the whole coffee fruit intact. It takes a lot longer to dry naturals, upwards of 3 weeks at Rosma, and the cherries ferment durig this time. While not always true, the dry process method is known for producing fruitier flavors, and certainly the case with this lot of Rosma. We found it to be quite a bodied coffee too, giving the wilder fruit and berry flavors some staying power in the finish.	Farm Gate	Our first of two lots from longtime partner producer, Finca Rosma, is a wild and woolly dry process coffee that promises big fruits, and winey accents. The fragrance has a wild berry side (as does the cup), with pulpy fruit accents, berry wine, jammy accents, and a hint of peach Kiefer. Pouring hot water on the ground coffee brings out potent fruits and berry notes, with syrupy sweet undertones, and wine-like fermented hints that permeate from the saturated grounds. One thing I really enjoyed about this dry process lot was that it has substantial bittersweetness behind the wild fruits, which gives you a lot of leeway to play with roast development if you want more of a bittersweet, fruited cup, rather than the other way around. At City roast, Rosma showed very fruity flavors that are most definitely tied to the dry process method. Flavor notes of blackberry wine, dried apple, prune were present, along with hints of dried mango, and fruit liqueur. Body was weighty in all of our roasts, even City, but Full City felt particularly thick. Add to that a flavor profile of dark chocolates filled with blueberry liqueur, and you have yourself quite a satisfying dark roast!	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-dry-process-finca-rosma-8070.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:39:54
263	Guatemala Huehuetenango Boqueroncito	87	September 2024 Arrival	Cuilco, Huehuetenango	Wet Process (Washed)	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	43	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon, Caturra, Catuai, Typica	SHB EP	.6 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen - we found a few partial quakers in the 200 grams roasted	Very versatile and sweet, with layered flavors of caramelized sugars, dried apple, cinnamon-laced cocoa power, and a zested lemon aspect that leads to a moderate level of acidity. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Boqueroncito is a farm very close to another we buy from the Hoja Blanca area of Huehuetenango, Finca Regalito. This area, located in the Northern reaches of Huehue at the border with Chiapas, Mexico is called Cuilco. Both Regalito and Boqueroncito are under the care of the Villatoro family, with Aurelio Villatoro overseeing the wet mill, and Antonio, his nephew, specifically looking after these two farms. We like these coffees and go through several of the process batch samples from the farms to select the best qualities they have to offer. These particular 43 bags are actually made up of two lots from the farm that we found to be interchangeable in terms of cup flavors. Boqueroncito starts at 1,400 meters above sea level and tops out at just under 1,550 meters. While that's not screaming high altitude for Guatemala, coffee is only planted up to about 1750 meters due to the colder climate here, which slows down the rate of cherry maturation, and aids seed density. The main image for this coffee shows Antonio and his uncle Aurelio, who manage the Boqueroncito farm.	Farm Gate	This lot from the Boqueroncito farm is versatile, and quite sweet. The dry grounds of lighter roasts have hints of loose-leaf tea atop a sweet molasses note, that at Full City is traded for deeper bittersweet cocoa roast tones, and a note of raisins. Adding hot water brings on a saturated sweetness of buttery caramel, with a hint of blackberry tea. This is a superb drinking coffee, syrupy-sweet, and offers structuring acidity in the lighter roasts. City+ brews show immense sweetness, brown sugar, along with aromatic spice impression. As the cup cools, Boqueroncito opens up to layers of caramelized sugars, dried apple, cinnamon-laced cocoa power, and a zested lemon aspect that informs a pleasantly moderate acidity level. The coffee has incredible body in the middle roasts, lightly fruited, but deep chocolate roast flavors fill out the middle and finish. It's a near-perfect single origin espresso in my opinion. Full City and FC+ roasts construct a shot with layered bittersweet flavors, chocolate, drinking cocoa, and bittering to the aftertaste. There are some very nice fruited accents like dark plum, and a note of lemon rind that punches through the bittersweetness.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-huehuetenango-boqueroncito-8072.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:39:57
264	Guatemala San Diego Buena Vista Java	87	July 2024 Arrival	Acatenango	Wet Process (Washed)	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City	33	46 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Java	SHB EP	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Strapped with sweetness, and subtle top notes bring out an elegant side. Sugar in the raw, whole clove, candied orange peel, tart rose hips tea, raisin, and a lemon note gives the acidity some lift. City to Full City.	This is a special small lot of Java variety coffee from Finca San Diego Buena Vista. The Java cultivar originated from Ethiopia, but had stop overs in Java and Cameroon, then finally Central America. The coffee is identifiable by the elongated shape of the seeds/beans, often described as having a "canoe" shape. The Java cultivar is seen throughout parts of Central America, most broadly represented in Nicaragua and Guatemala. It is recognized as producing unique cup flavors, specifically exhibiting tea-like top notes, and mouthcleansing acidity. This lot shows some of those delicate notes in quiet proportion, and I had the most success in pulling them toward the front when keeping the roast to City. San Diego Buena Vista is a 1500 meter farm just outside of Angigue, who we've bought from for more than a decade now, and have gone back for their variety separations of Bourbon, Typica, and Java, year after year. On our visits, we're always impressed with their practices, the way they have separated all the cultivars on the farm, and the beautiful condition of the mill. The mill is a vintage one with amazingly well kept-up machinery and the care is evident at every turn.	Farm Gate	This Java cultivar is strapped with sweetness, and the subtle top notes that come at City and City+ bring out an elegant side. The fragrance of the dry grounds have a clean scent of raw sugars laced with baking spices, cardamom and all spice powder, and loose leaf black tea. The sweetness in the wet aroma is perfumed with potent brown sugars, minimally processed types, such as turbinado or sucanat. Java cultivars can be tea-like and delicate, but the cup profile is very tied to roast level. We recommend keeping your roasts to City/City+ if you're looking to highlight those aspects, which roughly correlates to 10-20 degrees F from the start of 1st Crack on the Quest M3s I'm using. But don't let that sway you from roasting this coffee darker if that's your preference. This coffee had impactful sweetness at Full City too, just a bit more two-dimensional. Our City roast had an underpinning of raw sugar flavors that help push the sweetness score high for being such a light roast. The flavors are refined, and clean, with notes of sugar in the raw, and aromatic accents note of candied orange peel, and whole clove. There are some nice fruited suggestions too, like raisin, along with a tart accent of rose hips tea, and lemon peel that gives acidity some lift. I'd call this coffee brisk, not too bright, which suits the mild mannered, clean cup character.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-san-diego-buena-vista-java-7980.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:00
265	Guatemala Xinabajul Ana Morales	88	September 2024 Arrival	San Pedro Necta, Huehuetenango	Wet Process (Washed)	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City	22	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon, Caturra	SHB EP	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Balanced bittersweet flavors open up to hints of spiced fruit and refined acidity, with notes of golden plum, raisin, spice cookie, chocolate bar with dried coconut, and a pleasantly tea-tannic mouthfeel. City to Full City.	We've bought Ana Morales' coffee several times now, but usually in very small quantities that have been part of our "San Pedro Necta", small producer blend. The timing was right to see a lot more from Ana this year, and we were very pleased to select 22 bags that could be featured on their own. Her farm is located in Aldea Coles ("aldea" = village), which is part of the Municipality of San Pedro Necta, Huehuetenango. She and her husband inherited a small piece of land in 2013 that they planted in coffee, but unfortunately was not enough to make coffee their sole means of income. After seeking opportunities elsewhere, they decided to invest their resources into expanding, buying small parcels of land around them, and growing their farm. It's still a modest operation, and each year they produce around 80 bags of milled green coffee. The farm sits at 1800 meters above sea level and is primarily planted in Bourbon and Caturra varieties. She is part of our Proyecto Xinabajul small holder project in the region, which we started almost 15 years ago, working with locals to find great coffees and pay a good price. You can read more about Proyecto Xinabajul HERE.	Farm Gate	At first sip, Ana Morales' coffee showed well-rounded bittersweet flavors, like cocoa and brown sugar, and I immediately logged it as being the "crowd pleasing" type, almost a little basic. But as the coffee cooled, there proved to be a lot more going on than just roast tone. The coffee smelled very nice from the get go. Grinding a light roast released notes of fragrant raw sugars with understated hints of fruit. The wet aroma had powerful brown sugar notes, like chocolate malted grains, with a spritz of citrus. I brewed this a few different ways, and settled on my V60 pour over brewer as an effective method to highlight this coffee's 'bright' side. The sweetness is fairly complex at City roast level, pristinely clean, and opens up to a spiced raisin note, like holiday spice cookie. Bright fruits come through without imposing on core sweet flavors, with accents of tangy golden plum, and some bittering fruit skins and black tea. Acidity was a highlight of the light roasted coffee, and doesn't impact Full City roasts in the same way. It's still a nice cup, and carries flavor profiles of milk chocolate and sweetened coconut, like Mounds candy bars, and the tangy side is more from bittersweetness than anything that would allude to 'fruit'.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-xinabajul-ana-morales-8066.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:04
266	Guatemala Xinabajul Flavio Martinez	88	September 2024 Arrival	Peña Blanca, Huehuetenango	Wet Process (Washed)	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	41	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon, Caturra, Catuai Typica	SHB EP	.4 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Mouthwatering sweetness of creamy caramel and butterscotch, spiced apple sauce, and bracing acidity. More developed roasts carry a flavor of dark chocolate sauce with a hint of raisin. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	The micro region of Peña Blanca is located in the sub-municipality of La Libertad, Huehuetenango. This coffee comes to us through a joint-effort of two local micro-mill owners who are perform farmer outreach on our behalf finding and delivering many, many samples to us of coffees from family members and neighbors alike all over the Huehuetenango region. Each year we make several visits to the area in order to visit as many of these farmers as possible and cup hundreds of samples with the hopes of expanding our "Proyecto Xinabajul" project that we've had going in the region for nearly a decade. This particular microlot comes from a single farmer, Flavio Martinez, whose farm is located in Peña Blanca nearby one of our partners in the area. The coffee is a mix of Bourbon, Catuai, Caturra and Typica and is grown right around 1700 meters above sea level. At 41 bags, this is one of our more sizable, single farmer lots from Huehuetenango.	Farm Gate	While unrefined sugars and bittersweetness are the bolded print here, this coffee shows nuanced top notes and fairly bright acidity. This was especially the case when cup testing this lot next to a few of our more basic, crowd-pleasing Guatemalas where flavor contrast was pretty stark. The smells touch on clean raw sugars, as well as an accent of red fruits, and baking spice. The aroma lets off a wonderful scent of brown sugar and apple when adding the hot water, an array of raw sugar winding their way through the steam. This coffee brews incredibly well at a wide range of roasts and offers mouthwatering sweetness and fruited accents across the roast spectrum. Lighter roasts have juicy apple accents, accompanied by creamy caramel, and bittersweet intensity. The coffee cools to bracing acidity that is very malic (apple/pear), and the aftertaste had a hint of spiced apple sauce. At Full City we get sturdy chocolate flavors, like Ghirardelli dark chocolate sauce and dark truffles, along with a raisin accent note. As espresso, Full City roasts have a velvety mouthfeel, dried fruited accent notes, and bittersweet chocolate that hangs on long into the finish.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-xinabajul-flavio-martinez-8073.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:07
267	Guatemala Xinabajul Jose Villatoro	88	September 2024 Arrival	La Palmira, La Libertad, Huehuetenango	Wet Process (Washed)	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	37	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Caturra, Catuai, Typica	SHB EP	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Light roasts are cleanly sweet, honey and spice aroma, vibrant fruits of blackberry tea and apple cider, whereas chocolate bittersweets and body are the stars of the show when roasted dark. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This coffee is comes to us by way of Jose Villatoro, from the village of La Palmira in Huehuetenago's Libertad Department. While we often construct regional blends, we thought the two lots Jose delivered last year deserved to be showcased outside of a blend. When it was all said and done, there were 20 bags of coffee, which means it won't be a flash in the pan! Jose Villatoro's farm is situated around 1700 meters above sea level, and like most in this region, grows Bourbon, Caturra, Catuaí with a sprinkling of Typica trees scattered throughout. This coffee comes to us through a joint-effort of a local micro-mill owner who is able to process and separate the micro-lots we approve, and a highly sophisticated dry-mill who handle the finishing touches and export the coffees for us. It's also part of our "Proyecto Xinabajul" small holder project in the region, which you can read more about HERE.	Farm Gate	We found this year's coffee from Jose Villatoro to have an enticing fruited side that encompassed both ripe fruits, as well as tea-like, tannic notes. At City roast level, the dry fragrance had a complex notes of red fruits , along with a fragrant scent of sugar cane juice. The level of intensity comes up in the steam from the wetted grounds, culminating in elements of brown sugar, caramel, pear butter, and whole spices. Light roasts are produce bright fruit accents in the brew, tea-like in some aspects, but also like fresh fruit juice. All that is to say, the acidity level is quite nice for Guatemalan coffee! The cup has a well developed sweetness too at all roast levels we tried, with flavor profiles of honey, and raw sugar. Fruited top notes brought elements of blackberry tea, and pressed apple cider. Body is fairly juicy, a characteristic that is easily expounded on with more roast development. I found this coffee to have a sturdy core of sweet and bittering tones at Full City roast. Brewing light roasts as pour over yielded excellent results for pulling out the acidity and fruited sweetness, and I'm sure the Full City roast will make a delicious full immersion brew, like French Press, where body and bittersweetness will be the stars of the show. As espresso, this coffee's a home run. Our Full City roast extracted a tasty profile of chocolate-covered raisins, with acidity like berry skin.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-xinabajul-jose-villatoro-8077.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:12
268	Guatemala Xinabajul Libertad SWP Decaf	87	July 2024 Arrival	La Libertad, Huehuetenango	Wet Process, then Swiss Water Process Decaf	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	92	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon, Caturra, Catuai, Typica	SHB EP	1 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen - mostly broken beans from decaffeination	Well-balanced and delicious decaf, with brawny bittering cocoa offset by ample sweetness, and a nice acidic sparkle that's not too imposing but brings some structure to the cup. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Our latest Guatemalan decaf is a blend of coffees from several small farms in La Libertad, Huehuetenango. The farms making up this lot start at about 1500 meters and extend up to 1900+. Most are planted in a mix of cultivars, Bourbon, Caturra, Typica varietals mixed in. None of the coffees were bought as a lower quality for decaffing, which is so often the case. Rather, we spent a lot of time at the cupping table testing hundreds of samples in order to put together this, and the other regional blends we purchased. Once the coffee is imported, we break off a few bags from different selections so that we can have a delicious decaf blend as a compliment to our regular offerings as well. This decaf was processed by Swiss Water in Vancouver, BC, known the world over for their chemical-free, water-based decaf process technic that is gentle on the coffee and retains some of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma. Send off delicious regular coffee, receive a delicious decaf in return! It's important to keep in mind that all decaf processes slightly degrade the coffee's physical structure, which has an impact on roast dynamics. If you're able to control your heat input, I recommend applying heat slowly up until about 20F before 1st Crack, then pulling back some to avoid violent fracturing. On our Probat P12, that means slowly walking the gas up to 75%, and then dropping down to 25% (maybe less) well before I hear the first 'pops'. If you're using a popper, you might try increasing batch size to slow things down a bit. I should also note that you'll likely see surface oils no matter light or dark, also a bi-product of the structure being broken down to some degree.	Farm Gate	The dry fragrance presented deep cocoa notes and a pleasantly mild sweetness, chocolate covered almond, shortbread cookie, and a lot of bittersweet dimension. The wet aroma of my City+ and Full City roasts smelled right in-line with a medium-roasted, non-decaf Guatemalan coffee; balanced roast notes, bittersweet cocoa, and a hint of green herb that added some interest. Our brews were well-balanced and delicious, with brawny bittering cocoa that is offset by ample sweetness of raw sugars, and a nice acidic sparkle that's not too imposing but gives the cup some structure. The cooling cup yielded muted fruit tones that brought a juicy quality to lighter roasts, whereas Full City roasts harnessed this coffee's bittersweet side. This is going to be a fantastic espresso option, and definitely the one to check out for a more classic-toned, bittersweet shot.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-xinabajul-libertad-swp-decaf-7983.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:15

Balanced sweetness, accent notes of oatmeal raisin cookie, black tea with lemon, cocoa-crisped rice, and a lasting bittersweet finish. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	"Xinabajul" is the name of the original Huehuetenango town, and this coffee comes from small-holder farmers in the greater department of Huehue. Specifically, this small lot is a blend of coffees from six small producers in the growing areas of Santa Barbara, Cuilco, La Libertad and San Pedro Necta. In the past, small coffee producers in this area had few options when selling their coffee locally; they could take it to the large mills down at lower elevations and get paid the going rate, or they could sell it to "coyotes" who drive the dirt roads in their trucks paying cash for coffee. Neither offered any extra price for quality, even though the coffees were grown higher and tended with greater care than the big farms down at lower elevations. We partnered with local coffee people to offer higher prices if the farmers could meet our quality expectations in the cup, and this lot is testament to that success. Given that the localities where we are buying coffee are little more than extended family groups, we have found if we involve a brother or sister, they will tell all their coffee-farming kin and soon we have a network of farmers interested in our project. We wrote an in-depth and detailed description of the project as well.	Farm Gate	The cups are sweet-to-bittersweet depending on roast level, exhibiting mild top notes and acidity when roasted light, and chocolate bittersweets once you pass Full City. Raw sugar notes outline the fragrance from the dry ground coffee, with accents or raisin and milk chocolate. Adding the hot water stirs up a concoction of toffee and cinnamon in the steam, simple yet refined. The cup offers balanced sweetness at a variety of roast levels, and is a perfect "dual use" coffee for brewing and espresso. A moderate level of acidity shadows the cup at City roast levels, and has soft aspects of brewed black tea with lemon. Flavor components of minimally processed sugars lay out a nice base coffee flavor, along with hints of oatmeal raisin cookies, and cocoa-crisped rice. Chocolate roast tones are much more prominent at Full City/Full City+, where you'll find pungent roast tones of dark cocoa and burnt sugar, and a pleasant interplay of bittering and sweet flavors that will pair well with cream if that suits you! Full City is a great starting point for espresso shots, pushing syrupy dark chocolate flavors to the front, and creamy nut tones and long lasting bittersweetness into the aftertaste.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/guatemala-xinabajul-producers-8067.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:20

Brown sugar and caramel, dark chocolate and baking cocoa, toasted barley, chocolate granola, and pecan. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	While we've never visited Balmadi Estate, we were given the opportunity to buy this lot earlier in the year from an importer we often work with who was bringing in a container of Indian microlots. After tasting this peaberry offer sample from the Estate, we knew right away that it was a coffee we wanted to feature. It has the balanced sweetness, and moderate acidity similar to Central American coffees we buy, as well as the roast versatility. Balmadi Estate is located in Nilgiris region of Tamil Nadu state, which sites at the southernmost tip of India. In addition to coffee, they also grow many different spices, and tea. Their Arabica coffee is grown between 1500 and 1650 meters above sea level, and mostly planted with S-794 (aka "Line-S"). They use organic methods of production, without any chemical fertilizers or pesticides. The estate holds organic certification, however, this lot was not exported with the certificate.	\N	I often find myself drawing comparisons between coffees from different origins. For example, when cup testing this Indian coffee, I kept thinking to myself that the profile had a lot in common with coffees we buy from parts of Central America, like Nicaragua and El Salvador. Bittersweet flavors are well-balanced at a wide range of roasts, making it very useful in a lot of different brew methods. The fragrance of the dry grounds had low-toned bittersweetness at City+ and Full City, accented by savory hints of roasted nuts, and grains. The wet aroma was moderately sweet and had 'toasted' accents, like caramel-peanut brittle bar. The cup has layered bittersweet flavors that start off like dark chocolate, and peel back to reveal notes of chocolate granola, and some bitter baking cocoa in the aftertaste. My City+ roast had mild brown sugar and caramel notes, accented by hints of toasted barley, puffed rice cereal, and pecan. My Full City roast started to tip the scale in the direction of bittering chocolate, and I can see this being a good starting point for espresso.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/india-balmadi-estate-peaberry-8058.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:24

Dense body, low-toned flavors, pungent black pepper, tannic tea, savory notes of squash blossom, and roasted barley. City+ to French. Good for espresso.	We don't carry Robusta often, and when we do, it has to be a coffee that we would drink ourselves. Unlike Arabica, that's a surprisingly tall order! Robusta coffee can be infinitely bitter, and at times may seem like its only redeeming qualities are body and quite a caffeine jolt (it's no wonder that it's widely used as a cheap blend component). We initially inquired about this lot to fill a need for our Liquid Amber blend, in which we use a very small amount of high quality Robusta. But after tasting it, we knew it was one we also wanted to offer to those curious about this unique coffee plant species. This lot was sourced from the Kannagere Estate in Midgere, India, a town within the broader Chikmagalur District. Kannagere has been in operation for more than 70 years, currently under the care of third-generation coffee farmer named Shirish. This isn't a farm we've visited. Rather, an import partner we often work with was filling out a container, and gave us the opportunity to piggy-back just 20 bags.	\N	We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this Indian Estate Robusta. It has some of the bittering, savory flavors that are somewhat typical for Robusta, but also carried a mild sweetness, with overt spice note that made the cup quite interesting, and enjoyable. I will still preface this with the disclaimer that if you've not tried Robusta, the flavors can be quite shocking. Expect low sweetness, massive body, opaque low tones, and a range of savory-umami notes. That said, we even enjoyed this coffee light roasted (City+) which is pretty unheard of! The smells wafted cocoa nibs, roasted barley and a hint of malty sweetness. The cup flavors at Full City are linked by well-defined bittering cocoa notes, and the middle and finish are marked by interesting accents of pungent black pepper, vanilla, and bittering flavor of tannic black tea. This Robusta lot has incredibly dense body and mouthfeel (especially when roasted dark) that compliments inky chocolate roast flavors, and the cup cools to top notes of clove oil, unsweetened baking chocolate, savory squash blossom, and a note of roasted barley in the aftertaste. Robusta is often used as a body and crema component in espresso blends, as well as sturdy, deep-toned flavors. This lot ticks off all those boxes, and a little goes a long way. It's worth mentioning that that Robusta makes up 1/5 of our Liquid Amber blend, and for such a small amount, it plays a big role in the final cup profile.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/india-kannagere-estate-robusta-8034.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:27
272	India Monsoon Malabar	85	December 2023 Arrival	India	Monsoon	Mechanical	Full City+ to French - not a coffee for light roasting!	100	50 KG	GrainPro Liner	0	\N	\N	1+ d/300gr, 18+ screen - Monsoon coffee has been swelled with water and is a pale yellowish-white in color, split, and with some minor defects like bug holes	Best in the darker roast levels and as a blend component, bringing body and bitter low tones to espresso. Earthy and pungent cup, hints of toasted grains, roasted corn, and more. Its strength is body, and will make an interesting cup for fans of earthy, low acid cup, and an excellent addition to an espresso blend (we use it in Liquid Amber!). Full City+ to French.	Monsooned coffees are stored in special warehouses until the Monsoon season comes around. The sides of the structure are opened and moist monsoon winds circulate around the coffee making it swell in size and take on a mellowed but aggressive flavor. This Monsooned Malabar is sourced from several farms in Southern India. Typically, the coffee is naturally processed, then spread on the floor of the special monsooning warehouse, raked and turned around by hand to enable them to soak in moisture of the humid winds. The monsooning process takes around 12 to 16 months of duration, where in the beans swell to twice their original size and turn a pale golden color. Then they do additional rounds of hand sorting to remove any coffee that did not expand properly, and the coffee is prepared for export. This is an extremely pungent cup with a unique combination of burnt-bittering flavors, caramel finish and potent earthy aspects. It is not for those who like a "clean" cup, or sweet coffees! By all standard definitions, this is a defective set of cup flavors, though still quite interesting, unique, and not to mention, useful. (It's been a key component in our Liquid Amber espresso blend since the beginning!) Monsooned Malabar gets a free pass from the coffee censors because of cultural tradition, history, and the fact that (while it doesn't conform to the traditional ideas of good coffee) it is in it's own right a unique coffee flavor. It has some use in espresso blending with a preparation of longer drum roasting and resting (after roasting) of 3+ days. There are Italian espresso roasting companies that use this coffee in their "exotic" blend offering, along with 2-3 other non-monsooned arabicas to even out the cup and provide aroma and some sweetness. Even as a drip/infusion brew, the coffee mellows after 2 days and the cup is more balanced so resting is key to best cup results. Please see the physical appearance of the coffee in that first photo, as it can be quite a shock if you've never seen Monsoon coffee before! It's pale white, slightly 'speckled'. We do our best to find the best quality all around, and think this is one of the cleanest looking lot we've seen in a long time!	\N	There's nothing quite like Indian Monsooned coffee. It's all body, with intense, bittering roast flavors, and very low acidity. These aspects are what make it a go-to for so many espresso blends. In fact, it's a big part of the success of one of our most popular blends, Sweet Maria's Liquid Amber Espresso Blend. On its own, the cup is a bit of a shock to the palate. Much more bitter than sweet, caramel notes are merely hints brooding low tones. At Full City+ to French (FC+ should be the minimum), the cup has pungent bitter cocoa, unsweetened Baker's chocolate, spice, earthy accent notes, and a smokey aroma. The cup cools to interesting flavor accents like roasted corn, and earthy raw and roasted cacao nibs. Monsoon is for blending in our opinion, adding body and bittering low tones. It does not conform to standard cupping evaluation, and we added in a "cupper's correction" score of 8 to bump it up to 85 points as a way of expressing how we think this lot compares to other Monsoon coffees we've tried. It's an exotic flavor profile for sure, and perhaps an acquired taste. I recommend trying a very small amount at first to see if you like it, and also used sparingly for espresso blending - it will add quite a bit of crema and body to the shot.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/india-monsoon-malabar-7852.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:30

The Estate is massive, at over 2000 hectares of land, though not all of it is planted in coffee. They grow many other crops, like pepper, turmeric, and citrus, as well as coffee. The highest point at the farm is 1400 meters above sea level, and most of the coffee varieties are either Bourbon types, or disease resistant hybrids. "Garige" is the word for red cedar trees, of which there are quite a few on the property. This is one of a few wet process Arabica coffees offered to us by an import partner we work with. We don't buy enough Indian coffee annually to work in a more direct way, so having the option to pre-select coffees from someone we trust makes a lot of sense. We found this particular coffee to be well-balanced in the middle roasts, and moderately bright. We don't get the opportunity to buy really nice Indian coffees all that often, so we get excited when one like this comes across our cupping table!	\N	The dry fragrance had sweet accents of honey-sweetened granola, with hints of roasted cashew, and cinnamon. Adding hot water brought out a potent caramel note, interspersed with notes of cardamom, and toasted grains. At City+, the cup is moderately sweet, with pleasing flavors of raw sugar, toasted barley, and very nice perceived acidity. The mix of sweetness and savory umami notes pair really well, building profiles of caramel-coated popcorn, and sweetened brown rice tea. These flavors sort of linger in the aftertaste, fading to a powdery cocoa aspect in the long finish. With a little more roast development you can pull out some pretty hefty low tones that bring a nice intensity to the cup, and the level of sweetness remains supportive and sturdy.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/india-muthodi-garige-khan-estate-8056.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:34
274	Indonesia Nusantara SWP Decaf	86	January 2024 Arrival	Aceh, Sumatra and Java Sunda	Wet Hulled (Giling Basah), then SWP Decaf	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	42	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	0	Ateng, Jember, Tim Tim	Grade 1	.8 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen - expect some broken beans from the decaf process	Very approachable bittersweetness, with identifiable hints of origin characteristics like brown rice syrup, palm sugar, herbal tarragon, and some very subtle fruits. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	"Nusantara" is an old Javanese term that means the "outer islands", in reference to part of the Indonesian archipelago. While it was originally a bit more limited in which islands were included, it is now commonly used to refer to the entire chain of Indonesian islands. We are using this name for a blend of Indonesian coffees we sourced, reserving small quantities of each for a custom Swiss Water decaf. This lot of Nusantara includes wet hulled coffee from the islands of Timor Leste, a typical body/bittersweet blend component that comes through loud and clear in decaf! In addition, we've added a really interesting "honey labu" processed Sumatran coffee, a hybrid honey-wet hulled processing technic that we started seeing in Aceh a few years back. Both coffees were grown around 1500 meters above sea level. The honey labu coffees we've purchased have tasted more in line with sweet, and sometimes fruited, honey process coffees, rather than herbal, earthy wet hulled. Together, they construct a chocolate-laden, big bodied, decaf, that is best roasted in the middle, City+ to Full City+ roast range. This is where it shows peak chocolate characteristics while retaining a nicely developed sweetness to balance the cup. Fantastic dual-use decaf that also makes a great base blending ingredient. Try 1:1 with Ethiopia Gera Goma SWP Decaf (click here for Coffee Shrub) for a Moka Java blend. This decaf was processed at the Swiss Water Decaf plant where their patented chemical-free, decaffeination process is employed using only water to remove 99.9% of the caffeine content.	Farm Gate	This lot of Nusantara decaf shows the complex notes of herbal and earth found in wet hulled coffee, with more-than convincing chocolate roast flavors and a moderate sweetness for decaf coffee. I think the fact that it's 100% wet hulled coffee really boosted body in this decaf blend, which wound up being a real boon to espresso use too. The fragrance and aroma have a molasses bread sweetness, with notes of carob chips, herbal accents, and hint of pine oil. I cupped this next to a few other decafs and was surprised by the approachable bittersweetness, even at City+. Medium roasts have sweet notes of brown rice syrup and palm sugar, faint fruit hints, and accents of aromatic peat and herbal tarragon notes that add an earthy impression to the profile. All of these are aspects we expect in non-decaf wet hulled coffee, so it's very nice to taste the origin character post-decaffeination! This has "decaf espresso" written all over it. Chocolatey low tones and creamy body are uncompromising when taken straight, and the bittersweet bass notes will certainly stand up to milk too.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/indonesia-nusantara-swp-decaf-7855.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:37

Caramelized sugar, sweet tea, accents of hop flower, fresh spearmint, and Meyer lemon. City to Full City.	This wet process Javanese coffee is a small producer blend from farms near the mountain area of Gunung Tilu ("gunung" is the Bahasa word for a mountain peak). Farmers in this region grow coffee at an average altitude of 1500 meters, producing a mix of coffee cultivars. Here amongst the Ateng and Jember coffees are some old Typica trees, the original Typica, which is quite amazing. (Java was the first destination for coffee from Yemen, with a stopover in India). This lot was made up from coffee of 33 farmers in Tilu, who collectively pool their harvest together, and deliver it to a mill for processing some 200 km away in Tenjolaya Ciwidey. Java Sunda (West Java) was the original coffee area, but you would find few trees here of late. Most Java coffee is grown in the East, where the big estates are. But farmers in Java Sunda always kept small coffee plots, although they mainly grown rice, onions, cabbage, carrots and other food crops for local markets in Bandung and Jakarta. It's nice to see small lots from the different mountain villages in the region rather than the typically large, full-container blends.	\N	We love our wet process coffees from West Java ("Sunda"), and often find them to be a nice correlate to balanced coffees of Central America. In addition to balanced sweetness, Cimara had some interesting top note accents too. While we only tried it at a light roast, experience tells us that it will work well roasted dark as well. The ground coffee showed some herbal sweetness when roasted light, accent notes alluding to loose leaf green teas, citrus, lemon grass, and honey. The wet aroma had a candied sugar smell, along with a note of sweetened black tea. In the cup, we found a strong sweet base flavor that saturated the cup profile, balancing out roast tone, and some of the more complex herbal top notes. A flavor of caramelized sugars made a lasting impression on the brew, extending to a long, sweet finish. The coffee cooled to medium body, hints of Meyer lemon, sweet tea, and a pleasantly bright citrus note that was well-balanced with the rest of the flavors. Up front there was a hop flower accent in the aroma that faded to more herbal spearmint in the aftertaste.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/java-sunda-cimara-8149.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:41

Mexican chocolate, caramel, fresh herbs, cinnamon bark, and an aromatic pepper cask note. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This lot of wet hulled coffee was collected from small holder farmers near the mountain Tilu, in the Central part of West Java. It comes from a collector in this area who is buying coffee from the villages of Cipelah, Cianjur, Rancabali, and a few others. "Collectors" are intermediaries of sorts who buy partially processed coffee and full coffee cherry from small scale farmers and then often process the coffee down to the dried seed/bean. This particular collector built their own washing station last season, which opens up greater quality control than others who are only buying "gabbah", or wet coffee processed by the farmers they buy from. This region tends to hit its harvest peak earlier than many others, even though farms are relatively high elevation (1300 to 1500 meters). I don't know how much the timing of the harvest has to do with it, but the wet hulled lots from this region also seem to cup consistently high!	Farm Gate	This Java is a great example of wet hulled coffee done right, and is every bit as nice as our top Sumatran lots. The earthy flavors have a freshness about them, and the level of sweetness, and bittersweet intensity should bring wider appeal. Earthy notes are kept to a minimum in the ground coffee, with caramel at the top of my notes. It also showed some interesting accents of fragrant raw cane sugar, and fresh spearmint. The wet aroma had a really nice herbal overlay, dark sweetness underneath, and bittersweet intensity. City+ roasts have some notes of toasted caramel, Mexican chocolate, and woody cinnamon bark in the aroma. Bittersweetness is robust, and is easily developed in darker roasts without compromising sweetness. We picked up on interesting herbal notes as our cups cooled, fresh sage and oregano, and a peppery note that brought to mind pepper cask coffee. This is a great espresso option when roasted to at least Full City, syrupy, bittersweet, and lower acidity. The roast coloring is also quite uniform for wet hulled coffee, which is a plus for visually judging the roast level.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/java-sunda-wet-hulled-cipelah-7780.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:44
277	Java Sunda Wet Hulled Gunung Tilu	88	February 2024 Arrival	Tilu, Bandung, Sunda	Wet Hulled (Giling Basah)	Patio Sun-Dried	City to French - earthy and herbal at the lighter end	30	60 KG	GrainPro liner	1	Ateng, Djember, Jember, Typica	Grade 1	.8 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen	Brought to mind the herbal-sweet and earth-toned coffees of Sumatra. Rustic sugars, bittersweet low tones, lingering herbal/earthy notes of peat, eucalyptus, licorice root, and caraway. City to French. Good for espresso.	This wet hulled coffee is a small producer blend from farms near the mountain peak of Tilu ( peak is called "Gunung"). Tilu has a very high altitude, and farms in the nearby villages where this coffee was collected tend to stagger between 1600 and 1800 meters above sea level. The intermediary we are doing business with works closely with local farmers in West Java, wet-processing coffee in small batches to high standards. This lot is from a man named Dani, a farmer and collector in Gambung Pangkalan. Dani buys the wet process coffee farmers in Tilu, and then brings it back to his mill in Gambung where he peels the parchment, and dries it the rest of the way. This seemingly unorthodox way of processing coffee is called the wet hulled method, or "giling basah" as it's called in parts of Indonesia. Wet hulled coffee is deep toned and earthy, rustic, and often produces big body and very low acidity. (It's no surprise that wet hulled coffees are often used in espresso blends). It's the traditional processing method in Sumatra, and a big part of what put Sumatran coffee on the map. Java Sunda (West Java) was the original coffee area, but you would find few trees here of late. Most Java coffee is grown in the East, where the big estates are. But farmers in Java Sunda always kept small coffee plots, although they mainly grown rice, onions, cabbage, carrots and other food crops for local markets in Bandung and Jakarta.

It's nice to see small lots from the different mountain villages in the region rather than the typically large, full-container blends.	Farm Gate	This wet-hulled coffee from Java brought to mind the herbal-sweet and earth-toned coffees of Sumatra. The dry fragrance gave us glimpses of this layered into the sweetness, with notes of molasses, herbal accented hints of root beer, and caramelized sugar. The wet aroma smelled like rice syrup, and rustic caramel, and had an herbaceous side on the break that reminded me of coffees from Lintong. While not always the case with wet hulled coffee, I wouldn't hesitate to roast this Java coffee light. My City roast had some woodsy notes, but the underlying sweetness balanced it out, and also carried a pleasantly mild acidic impression. The cup had flavor notes of brown sugar and spices, like nutmeg and cinnamon, accented by lingering herbal/earthy notes of peat, and eucalyptus. Full City+ roasting developed intense roast bittering, accented by wisps of licorice root, and caraway seed. Highly recommended for dark-roasted espresso, milk drinks, and as a bittersweet, bodied blend base too.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/java-sunda-wet-hulled-gunung-tilu-7917.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:48
278	Kenya Dry Process Kagunyu	90	October 2024 Arrival	Karatina, Nyeri	Dry Process (Natural)	Raised Bed Sun Dried	City to Full City	20	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	SL-28, SL-34	AB	.4 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	This unique dry process Kenyan coffee pushes big fruit flavors in the cup, like rustic dried apricot and plum, peach Italian cream soda, spiced fruit chutney, fermented kombucha, and woody Chai spices. City to Full City.	This unique dry process lot comes from the Kagunyu Factory ("factories" = wet mills that are organized as cooperatives), part of the Rumukia Farmer Cooperative Society in Karatina area of Nyeri county. While we tend to mostly buy wet process Kenyan coffees, known for clean and bright flavors, we're also drawn to fruity dry process lots like this. The cup profile showed a lot of stone fruit character, and heady spice notes, like woody Chai tea. It's quite a contrast to the other Kenya's on our site, and I recommend it to those who enjoy dry process coffees from Ethiopia (or really anyone who enjoys wilder, unrestrained flavors!). Kagunyu Factory is close to Mukurwe-ini, and was formerly part of this society until it fell apart in the '90s. Within the same Rumukia group are some other fantastic stations we have offered coffee from in the past: Kiawamururu, Gatura, and Tambaya to name a few. The altitude is 1600+ meters above sea level, and growing areas in the fertile foothills of Mt. Kenya and Aberdare ranges. Most farmer members have on average only 250 coffee tress: a "garden" more or less. Again, in Kenya coffee "societies" the farmer's plots are so small, they are measured in numbers of trees, not in area of land as they are in other coffee origins. But this means that co-ops provide micro-management of every coffee tree by the owner of the land, not by a large-scale agriculture operation like the big estates of Kiambu or Thika. The member farmers have the two preferred coffee varieties under cultivation, SL-28 and SL-34, with the vast majority of trees being SL-28.	Farm Gate	While we tend to focus on sourcing wet process Kenyan coffees, we tasted a few dry process offers last season that we just had to have. Kagunyu was one of them. It pushed big fruit flavors in the cup that were a bit rustic, like dried fruit, with some more complex fermented notes too. The ground coffee released a scent of dried stone fruit and mango, with a creamy note of fruit smoothie. After pouring hot water on the grounds, the crust that formed at the top of our glasses had a powerful sweetness of caramelized sugars, accented by notes of berry sauce, fermented peach, and woody whole spices. At City roast level, the brewed coffee had very nice stone fruit flavors that came off like kombucha, dried apricot, and peach Italian soda with cream. There's a very pleasant acidity in the lighter roasts, also reminiscent of stone fruit. As the coffee cooled down a bit, we noted flavor profiles of spiced fruit chutney, orange marmalade, and woody Chai spices. Our darkest roast was only City+, which brought out some red fruits and berries, like fermented blackberry, and dried plum. This coffee's sweet finish was also something that stood out to us, and it does a great job balancing fruit flavors, and some of the rustic cup qualities.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-dry-process-kagunyu-8118.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:51
279	Kenya Kirinyaga Kii AA	92	July 2024 Arrival	Kiamabara, Kirinyaga	Wet Process (Washed)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City	60	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	SL-28, SL-34, Batian, Ruiru-11	AA	.2 d/300gr, 17-19 Screen	Light roasts of Kii are lively and bright, citrus flavors central to the cup, notes of blood orange, pink grapefruit, and the bittering-brightness of a zested lemon, with spice accents of Darjeeling tea, and whole clove. City to Full City.	This coffee comes to us from the Kii factory, located in the Kiamabara growing area. This is a cooperative coffee - part of the Rung'eto Farmers Cooperative Society - but in Kenya they're called "factories" which is quite fitting really. I think of factories as an assembly line of sorts, where there is absolute consistency to the product output. This rings true for coffees that come from many of the Kenya factories we deal with. Year after year they have an astonishing ability to consistently produce sweet, clean, and complex coffees. Like most of the cooperatives in the area, members tend to much smaller plots of coffee trees than their estate farm competition, thus having more control over the production of ripe cherry. The average altitude is right around 1800 meters above sea level, and most of the small holder farmers contributing to this washing station grow SL-28, and SL-34 cultivars (both Bourbon hybrid from the 1930's developed by Scot Labs), along with some Batian and Ruiru-11. This AA lot is beautifully prepped, and was the star of the samples we tasted from the station. "AA" refers to the size of the beans, which are 17/64 to 19/64 of an inch. We typically buy AA, AB (slightly smaller), and the Peaberry Kenya separations, but it's important to understand that they all come from a single lot of coffee. Coffee beans come in all different sizes, and the dry mills use large machinery with screens to sort out different size ranges. AA don't always equate to a "better" cup, but they do command the highest price. In this case, it was worth it!	Farm Gate	This lot from Kii is such a nice, brilliant coffee at lighter roast levels, with bright citrus, and refined sweetness throughout. It's also a great Kenya for medium-dark roast too, the fruit flavors shift a bit, acidity a little more rounded, though not diminished altogether. At City roast level, the grinds showed aromatic honey sweetness, white frosting, accented by bright fruits of citrus and stone fruits, and baking spice accents. The wet aroma smelled incredible, sweet and tart notes of rock sugar and citrus candies, lemon drops, and a spiced fruit note of mulled cider. This is a bright, lively cup, fully sensed in a hot brew. Citrus flavors are a central component of light roasts, giving the cup a refreshing feel, with notes of blood orange, the sweet-tart aspects of pink grapefruit juice, and the bittering-brightness of a zested lemon. Sweetness runs deep and helps balance the high tones, furnishing an underlying flavor profile of sugar cane juice and simple syrup made with raw sugars. The vibrant acidity is attention-grabbing, and the middle and finish are marked by complex spice notes as the coffee cools, like Darjeeling tea, whole clove, and more. For me, City to City+ is where this coffee really sings. But if the tone is too bright, edging toward Full City tames the punchy acidity some, and citrus notes are transformed to darker berry notes that are juicy and sweet.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-kirinyaga-kii-aa-8012.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:54

Sugar cane, English Breakfast tea with lemon, orange essence, spiced accents of ginger and coriander powders, and a hop-like floral aroma. City to Full City.	Kangunu Farmers Cooperative Society is located about 140 km North West of Nairobi in Murang'a North district of the Central Province. I had bought this coffee in the past, but we don't often focus on Murang'a lots because they are often a bit less dynamic in the cup than Nyeri region coffees. But the Murang'a area is a rich agricultural oasis on the slopes of the Aberdare Mountains. Kangunu is at 1740 meters, endowed with rich volcanic soils that are deep, well drained and have a lot of organic material that are beneficial for coffee. As with other good coops in Muranga, the farmers typically hand sort the coffee cherry before submitting it for processing, removing coffee that's either not ripe, or too ripe, and can cause a defect in the cup. Small things like this make a huge difference in the resulting coffee. This is an AA outturn, which are the largest beans that measure between 17/64" to 19/64". While screen size doesn't necessarily equate to a better cup, AA grades command the highest price. You can see our video of Kenya processing in action here.	Farm Gate	The fragrance of the dry grounds have a well-focused sweetness at City and City+ roast levels, giving off a scent of minimally processed sugars, and hints of citrus and spice. Citrus notes come alive in the wet aroma, where brown sugar and caramel notes also see a big boost, and are cut through by notes of orange, lemon, and a spice sachet. This coffee brought out well-developed sweetness, and mouth-refreshing acidity at both City and Full City roast levels. The lighter roast was quite bright, and a sweet flavor of sugar cane was illuminated by a vibrant accent of English Breakfast tea with lemon. The cup cooled to hints of orange essence, spiced accents of ginger and coriander powders, and a hop-like floral aroma in the finish. At City+ to FC, darker fruit notes kick in, like dried plum and raisin, with caramel and chocolate roast tones. There was something aggressive about Full City roasts too, suggested by the sharpness of bittersweet tones and a rindy citrus mouthfeel in the finish. Along with the marked brightness, this interesting finish elevates this to the level of a "tongue-twisting Kenya", a very complex and big coffee on the palate.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-muranga-kangunu-aa-8004.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:40:58

City to Full City.	Gatugi is one of several coffees we picked up from Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society (FCS), an FCS that includes an impressive amount of wet mills, 18 in all, dating back to the late 1950s. Gatugi Factory sits at just under 1900 meters above sea level, right along the Ichamama River, which is fed from the Karima forest above. "Factories" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular "society" in Kenya, what we would call a "cooperative". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. Being one of the older Kenya FCS, we are well aware of the quality coming out of Othaya. A lot of hand labor goes into the post-harvest processing. From farmers removing under ripe and over ripe coffee cherries on delivery, to coop workers sorting out defects at the drying beds, the impact all this work has on the cup can't be overstated (we have a great video illustrating this work, here). This is the AA outturn, which just means it's the largest bean separation from a particular coffee process batch. I often let my AA Kenyas run a few seconds longer in the roaster than a smaller bean in order to allow for proper internal roast development. Roasted too fast and light, and you might wind up with grassy/raw flavors from an underdeveloped center.	Farm Gate	What a pristine cup this lot from Gatugi makes, with refined sweetness that has the transparency of simple syrup, and bright fruit flavors that bring remarkable lift in light roasts. The dry fragrance of a City roast had smelled lively, with a fruit salad of berries and citrus, along with aromatic 5 spice, and fresh ginger. The wet aroma was intensely sweet, with notes of sugar cane juice, cranberry sauce, juicy orange, as well as an accent of loose-leaf black teas. Citrus flavors made their mark in the brewed coffee, and had juicy fruit aspects of different types of citrus, like tangerine, and pink grapefruit, which fed into brilliant acidity that shimmered bright. The profile unfolds to include accents of tropical passion fruit, and red berries that impart a ripe, juicy aspect, fresh in flavor. The aftertaste is clean and refined, with finishing flavors that hint at black tea, with clove oil aroma in the finish. With a bit more roast development, the fruit flavors are darker, still juicy and bright, with immense sweetness anchoring the cup, and a faint bittersweet roast accent in the finish. But don't take Gatugi too dark and risk covering up the clean and vibrant flavors that make it such a super star Kenyan coffee.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-nyeri-gatugi-aa-8087.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:02

Notes of red berry, Meyer lemon, spiced black tea, bergamot orange, and sweet finish. City to Full City.	This coffee is from the Ichamama Factory, a washing station near Karima Hill in Nyeri. The station was named after the Ichamama river which flows near enough to the station to be the source of water for processing coffee. Ichamama is one of 19 washing stations that make up the Othaya Farmer's Coopertive Society, a coop-run organization, one of the older ones I might add. Othaya started in the mid-1950s, ballooning from 250 original members to 15,000 strong today. Karima is one of the older of the group, erected in 1964, and currently with nearly 1,000 farmer members (and is one of the most productive of the 19). The station sits at about 1750 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown in the higher altitude areas surrounding it. This lot "AB" is a separation of the medium-large sized beans measured in a range of 15/65" to 17/64". When compared with the two other upper tier grades "Peaberry" and "AA", it's not always indicative of higher or lower quality, though the cash premium spread generally favors the AA slightly more than AB or Peaberry. Check out our processing video taken during our 2024 travel that illustrates some of the unique ways in which Kenyan coffee is processed.	Farm Gate	At City and City+ roasts, the stage is set for complex sweetness in the cup profile. The dry fragrance confirms this, with a deeply sweet caramelized sugar scent in the ground, and also sees notes of dried fruits, and fresh hops folded in. After pouring the hot water, accents of butterscotch and caramel come up in the steam, accented by notes of candied ginger, and lemon balm that bring a perfumed quality to the mix. In the brewed coffee, a mingling of flavorsome citrus and raw sugar notes pair very well, and bring grounding sweetness to the fairly high-toned coffee. Light roasts are fruited, and notes of dark berry, aromatic Meyer lemon, and black tea are revealed as it cools. The citrus flavors are grabby, buttressed by flavor aspects of dark brown sugar, and with a slight caramelizing/cooked sugar sweetness in the aftertaste. City to City+ roasts shimmer in terms of brightness, and cool to tart citrus accent notes, along with spiced black tea, and hint of bergamot orange on the nose. Our Full City roasts was no slouch either, and manage to squeeze plump sweetness from a syrupy chocolate flavor base, along with notes of dark berry, and black currant.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-nyeri-ichamama-ab-8008.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:06

Cane sugar, caramel, black tea, apricot, and lemon balm. City to Full City+. Good Kenyan espresso.	Kamoini is one of several coffees we picked up from Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society (FCS). Othaya got its start back in the 1950s and currently have 18 coffee factories (wet mills) under their umbrella. Kamoini Factory sits at 1825 meters above sea level, right along the Ichamama River, which is fed from the Karima forest above. "Factories" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular "society" in Kenya, what we would call a "cooperative". Farmers typically hand sort the coffee cherry before submitting it for processing, removing coffee that's either not ripe, or too ripe, and can cause a defect in the cup. Small things like this make a huge difference in the resulting coffee. Check out our processing video taken during our 2024 travel that illustrates some of the unique ways in which Kenyan coffee is processed. This is an "AB" separation, which denotes the size of the beans. All coffee in Kenya is sorted by size using large industrial screening machines. There's a grading name attached to each size range, like "AA" for the largest beans, or in this case, "AB", which means that the beans fall between 15/64" and 17/64". Honestly, this doesn't always equate to a quality difference in the cup, but it does affect the price. (AA's typically command the highest prices).	Farm Gate	Kamoini AB showed convincing level of sweetness in the cup at a wide roast range, and is a Kenya worth trying as espresso. The acidity level is more modest for Kenya, which also makes it a more approachable option for those who tend to shy away from the citric high tones. It boasts convincing sweetness in the dry fragrance, caramelized sugars, spiced snickerdoodle cookie, and a fragrant profile of raisin muffin. The wet grounds showed very sweet caramelized sugar notes, crisped caramel and butter toffee crunch, with soft hints of citrus and dried fruits. Kamoini yields a fairly well-balanced Kenyan cup profile, and our City to City+ roasts showcased an underpinning of sweetness, without being overly citric, and bright. The cup profile has a sweet cane sugar note that resonates in the aftertaste, accented by notes of caramel, and honey. The sweetness gives way to brisk accents of black tea, apricot, and lemon balm, and presents a very nice juxtaposition of creamy mouthfeel and delicate top notes. Darker roast are a bit more two-dimensional in flavor, but offer rock-solid core sweetness of raw sugars and dried fruit, along with some background bittersweet cocoa roast flavors. This is a Kenyan espresso option if there ever was one!	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-nyeri-kamoini-ab-8092.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:09
284	Kenya Nyeri Mahiga Peaberry	91	September 2024 Arrival	Othaya, Nyeri	Wet Process (Washed)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City	30	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	SL-28, SL-34, Ruiru-11	Peaberry	.2 d/300gr, 15 Peaberry Screen	Mahiga makes a refined Kenya cup, with raw sugars and punchy fruit notes, peach and tart apricot, pineapple upside down cake, brown sugar, cardamom, and a bright splash of acidity. City to Full City.	The Mahiga Factory washing station sits at 1800 meters in the Othaya constituency of Nyeri County. With just over 500 farmer members, Mahiga collects and processes the whole coffee cherry for farmer members using a disc depulping machine before fermenting the coffee in order to remove the sticky demucilage layer. After the fruit is removed, the coffee is then soaked in clean water where they are completely "washed" of any remaining fruit residue, and then dried on raised coffee drying beds. Farmers in the region grow mainly SL-28 and SL-34, with small amounts of Ruiru mixed in. Mahiga is one of several coffees we picked up from Othaya Farmers Cooperative Society (FCS), an FCS that includes an impressive amount of wet mills, 18 in all, and their work in the region dates back to the late 1950s. Coffee is processed and kept separate by process batch at the factory in order to identify quality. (See our video on Kenya processing, here). The separated batches are then run through screens in order to separate beans by size, the most common being AA (17-19 screen), AB (15-17 screen), and Peaberry, all of which are referred to as "out-turns". This is the Peaberry outturn, a natural mutation that occurs where only 1 of 2 coffee seeds inside the coffee cherry germinates, causing it to take on a small, round shape like the cherry itself. We found it to have more of a delicate fruited side than the other lots we tasted from this station.	Farm Gate	This peaberry lot from Mahiga brews up a refined cup profile, with clean sugary sweetness and fruit notes that punchy, and aromatic. The dry fragrance had a sweet smell of red fruit and berry tea, with notes of raw sugar, and a grapefruit peel accent added a fragrant aspect to the sweetness. The wet aromatics were nicely fruited as well, both my City and City+ roasts displayed compote-like fruits, pie filling, and stone fruits. The cup was bright, especially when roasted to City/City+, where a splash of berry-like acidity (tartaric) added a nice charge to the flavor profile. My City roast had a sweet-tart hint of apricot, and a juicy fruit punch note. There's a brown sugar flavor that brings out some cooked fruit notes too, like pineapple or peach upside down cake. Full City roasts offer surprisingly robust bittersweetness, a flavor of fine Dutch drinking cocoa, and the plump dark fruits are still very much a part of the profile too. I really enjoyed this coffee from a light City roast on up to Full City, but would not venture into 2nd crack.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-nyeri-mahiga-peaberry-8095.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:12
285	Kenya Nyeri Mihuti AA	91	July 2024 Arrival	Mihuti town, Mukurwe-ini, Nyeri	Wet Process (Washed)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City	39	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	SL-28, SL-34, Ruiru-11, Batian	AA	.2 d/300gr, 17-19 Screen	Acidity is the star in light roasts, a lemony snap cuts through sweetness of raw sugars and honey, with notes of pomelo, fragrant yuzu, limeade, and a candied ginger note adds to the aroma. City to Full City.	This pristine AA grade selection comes from the Mihuti wet mill in Mihuti town, located Nyeri's Mukurwe-ini Constituency. This area lies between Mount Kenya and the Aberdares range, and boasts a modest altitude of 1700 meters in town, stretching up higher in the surrounding hillside farms. It's a rural agricultural zone, mostly made up of coffee and dairy farmers. Mihuti "Factory" (the term for "washing station" in Kenya) operates under the Rugi Farmer's Cooperative Society, an umbrella organization that oversees operations of their associated wet mills, and helps with things like agronomical support to farmers, pre-financing during the harvest season, and marketing the coffees. It's my understanding that Rugi is an older coop, started back in the late 1960's. We've purchased coffees from other Rugi wet mills, like Igutha, but this is the first year we've both Mihuti. Rugi's membership is currently around 4500 people, whose farms are typically 1 hectare or less. After depulping the coffee, they ferment the coffee overnight to beak down the sticky fruit mucilage surrounding the seeds. The coffee is then soaked and washed in clean water, then moved to raised drying beds where it will dry for around 1-2 weeks. See our video on Kenya post-harvest processing, here.	Farm Gate	Mihuti struck me as having a floral-type sweetness in the dry grounds, a sweetness so potent that it conveyed a perfumed quality. The fragrance showed aromatic notes of unrefined sugars, butterscotch, honey, with some subtle spice notes have a nice contrasting effect, though much lower intensity. The wet aroma smelled saturated with notes of brown sugar, and honey, and an accent of honey-sweetened black tea. In the cup, acidity was the star in my lightest City roast. A lemony snap really woke me up, and had tart flavor aspects of lemon water, and some sharp notes of pamplemousse/pomelo. The sweetness is certainly still present, and offered glimpses of raw panela-type cane sugar, and Manuka honey. A spiced top note of candied ginger brought a very nice aromatic side to the sweetness, along with a hint of fragrant yuzu citrus. Light roasts have thinner body, which I think that works well this kind of light and bright profile. I roasted as dark as Full City (32F past the start of 1st Crack on my Quest M3s), which developed bigger body, along with juicy black fruits, and bittersweet roast tones in the middle and finish.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-nyeri-mihuti-aa-8009.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:16

City to Full City.	This coffee is from the Gatuyaini Factory, a washing station more or less. Nothing industrious about it, except for the machinery to wash and depulp coffee cherries! Gatuyaini is one of 19 washing stations that make up the Othaya Farmer's Coopertive Society, a coop-run organization, one of the older ones I might add. Othaya started in the mid-1950s, ballooning from 250 original members to 15,000 strong today. Altitude of the washing station is just shy of 1900 meters, and you mostly see SL-28 and SL-34, along with a little Ruiru mixed in. We keep returning to the societies who regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees we see, and each year we come across coffees new to us - like Gatuyaini - and this list continues to grow. This is an "AB" separation, which denotes the size of the beans. All coffee in Kenya is sorted by size using large industrial screening machines. There's a grading name attached to each size range, "AA" for the largest beans, and in this case, "AB", which means that the beans fall between 15/64" and 17/64". Honestly, this doesn't always equate to a quality difference in the cup, but it does affect the price. AA's typically command the highest prices. And while we bought plenty of AA coffee this year, this AB lot from Gatuyaini won us over! See our video on Kenya post-harvest processing, here.	Farm Gate	A cleanly spiced sweetness comes up from the ground coffee, with spikes of citrus tea, and grape-toned fruit. The wet aromatics are heavily-laden with dark sugar smells, complex spice notes like clove syrup, and candied ginger, and dried floral accent. We roasted to both City and Full City roast levels for this review, making for quite different cup experiences. Orange citrus brightness is present from light to dark, but most brilliant on the light end of that spectrum (no surprise). This isn't a fruit-bomb cup, rather it revolves around ample raw sugar complexity, and a variety of citrus, and dried fruit accent notes. A steady undercurrent of brown sugar and cinnamon hints provide a solid platform for citrus highlights to shine, offering up profiles of holiday spice cookie, and dried citrus notes. As the cup cools down a bit, delicate flavors start to emerge, like pomegranate tea, cardamom, dried stone fruit, and orange. Full City roasts show a departure from bold high tones, though still present, and are more like citrus zest rather than fresh juice. Smokey cocoa fills out the middle and finish and is accompanied by notes of dark grape juice, clove, and juicy body.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-othaya-gatuyaini-ab-8093.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:20

Notes of semi-refined sugars, tart pomelo and orange, herbaceous lemongrass hint, and complex aroma. Nice dark roasted Kenya too. City to Full City+.	The Mahiga Factory washing station sits at 1800 meters in the Othaya constituency of Nyeri County: With just over 500 farmer members, Mahiga collects and processes the whole coffee cherry for farmer members using a disc depulping machine before fermenting the coffee in order to remove the sticky demucilage layer. After the fruit is easily removed, the seeds are then soaked in clean water where they are completely "washed" of any remaining fruit residue, and then dried on raised beds. Farmers in the region grow mainly SL-28 and SL-34, with small amounts of Ruiru mixed in. Mahiga is one of several coffees we picked up from Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society (FCS), an FCS that includes an impressive amount of wet mills, 18 in all, and their work in the region dates back to the late 1950s. Coffee is processed and kept separate by day or even weekly deliveries at the factory in order to identify quality. The separated batches are then run through screens in order to separate beans by size, the most common being AA (17/64" to 19/64" screen), AB (15/64" to 17/64" screen), and Peaberry, which are refered to as "outturns". This is the AA outturn. These large beans always command the highest price, and while not always signifying a superior cup to the others, the quality of this lot intersects with the premium paid! See our video on Kenya post-harvest processing, here.	Farm Gate	Mahiga brews up pronounced sweetness in the cup, with fruited undertones that feed into mouthpleasing acidity in the lighter roasts. The ground coffee had citrus notes of lemon and orange, with brown sugar sweetness, and a light accent of cocoa powder. The wet aroma had the warmth and sweetness of fruit reductions, especially strong in the middle roast range, with a rindy citrus accent. The fruited elements find a nice supporting sweetness in the brew, a bit transparent, like simple syrup, but then shifting to less refined types in the finish (think turbinado, demerara, etc...semi-refined sugars that still have some molasses). A citrusy tang lead to flavors of pomello and orange, as well as a fragrant lemongrass note that adds a pleasantly herbaceaus hint to the profile. The acidity is well-structured and bright at City roast level, due in large part to the citrus flavor aspects. Spiced notes of cardamom and mace complimented the fruited cup flavors and added to a complex aroma. I don't often recommend Full City roasts for Kenya's, but found Full City roasts of Mahiga to be juicy and delicious. Deeper roast development brought out very positive fruit flavors, like grape and dark orange, along with notable dark chocolate low tones, and substantially thick body. It still produced a moderate level of fruited acidity too, making it a unique dark roasted coffee.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-othaya-mahiga-aa-8114.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:23

Barley malt syrup, molasses, caramel, cocoa powder, and apple accent. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	The Sierra Mariscal region butts right up against the Guatemalan border, both positioned in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountain range and benefiting from the range of altitude, micro-climates, and nutrient rich volcanic soil. Within Sierra Mariscal is the town of Motozintla, which is where this coffee is from. It comes to us by way of a group of small producers in Motozintla, most who have gone through the process of organic certification (though this coffee is not certified). The coffee farms are at 1500 meters above sea level on average and you still see a lot of Typica planted on coffee farms, along with Bourbon, Caturra and Catuaí. We found this coffee checked off boxes for chocolate bittersweets, body and nutty roast tones. It's versatile in the roaster, but I prefer a nice Full City roast as immersion brew myself. It's a coffee that pairs well with milk, but certainly satisfies 'solo' too as a chocolatey-rich, morning brew.	\N	Sierra Mariscal offers an attractive cup profile across a wide roast spectrum, crowd-pleasing, not too showy, the top notes pleasantly restrained amidst core caramel flavors, and bittersweetness. The dry fragrance has a sticky molasses smell, with bittersweet cocoa not far behind, and hints of candied nuts. I found a little more roast intensity in the wet aroma, with milk chocolate, brown sugar, and a greenish pistachio note in the steam. City-City+ roasts have sweetness that reminds me of barley malt syrup, and offered glimpses of acidity in the cup profile. Molasses and caramel come through, along with hints of cocoa powder and red apple. My Full City roast extracted delicious chocolate characteristics that are buoyed by body, with a well developed sweet underlay. Flavors of high % cocoa solids chocolate and roasted cacao are what we noted, substantial chocolate flavors that resonated in the aftertaste.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/mexico-chiapas-sierra-mariscal-8081.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:27

It lies in the shadow of the Sierra Madres de los Chiapas range, in a town called El Retiro. El Desvió is managed by Yenyoset Escobar Perez, who grew up working the land with his father, eventually inheriting the farm as an adult. Yenyoset has made improvements at the farm since taking over, employing a regular pruning schedule to help improve the health of the trees, and also going through the certification program for NOP Organic. Yenyoset pulps his coffee into cement tanks where he ferments with water for 12-17 hours. He then washes the coffee twice with clean water in order to help remove any remaining sticky fruit mucilage left behind. Finally, the coffee is moved to cement patios to dry for upwards of two weeks.	Organic/Fair Trade Cert.	Grinding the coffee let off a scent of raw sugar, with herbal-like notes green tea, and sappy pine, with a hint of toasted almond. The wet aroma smelled of pungent bittersweet cocoa, flanked by a note of punchy burnt sugar. The herbal/pine-like aroma came through in the cup too, especially in our lighter roasts. It's an interesting contrast to the deeper sweet tones of caramelized sugars underneath. Ample body adds to a mouth-pleasing cup too, along with some black tea-like tannic aspects that pull at your tongue. Acidity is well-balanced, and the aroma came up as the coffee cooled, showing hints of herbal tea, and mint leaf. We didn't roast this coffee all that dark, but going off the cup flavors, and what we know about coffees from Chiapas, it's safe to say this coffee will work well dark roasted too.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/mexico-organic-chiapas-el-desvio-8080.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:30

"El Rosario" is the name of the farm in Southern Chiapas where this coffee was grown. It lies in the shadow of the Sierra Madres de los Chiapas range, in a town of the same name ("Rancho El Rosario"). The farm is managed by Victor Abel Alvarado, who grew up working the land with his father, eventually inheriting the farm as an adult. The farm is still very much a family affair, with his father very much involved, though Victor makes all the decisions. It wasn't long after taking over that they went through the process of obtaining  certification program for NOP Organic, which not only means they are employing environmentally sustainable farming practices, but also means an added financial premium for their coffee. Victor pulps his coffee into cement tanks where he ferments his coffee for a few hours. He then washes the coffee in order to help remove any remaining sticky fruit mucilage left behind. Finally, the coffee is moved to cement patios to dry for upwards of 1 week.	Organic/Fair Trade Cert.	The fragrance had a sweet-savory note of caramel-coated nuts, along with brown sugar, and a note of spiced apple pie. I'm sure origin informed our impression a bit here, but the aroma brought to mind Mexican spiced cocoa, like "Abuelita" hot chocolate, along with wisps of caramelized sugars. Brewing this coffee, the balance that was struck between sweet and bittering coffee flavors came off as a perfect "every day" coffee that's sure to appeal to a broad audience. A lot of what was smelled in the grounds, and wet aroma came through in the brew too. Our City+ roast showed lots of positive cocoa bitterness that played off moderately sweet notes of raw sugars. The cup acidity had an apple element, which brought out notes of dried apple and spiced cider. It's very well-balanced profile that should also do well as dark roasted brew and espresso.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/mexico-organic-chiapas-el-rosario-8079.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:33

Geta Bore is a cooperative in Ethiopia's Illubabor region, Bore Woreda to be exact, not far from Agaro. The cooperative falls under a larger umbrella "Union" that includes other Western coops we buy from like Duromina, Nano and Genji Challa, Yukiro and more.  Being a cooperative, it is member-owned and leadership and decision making are a group-effort on the part of the member base. The Union provides the coops under their umbrella with agronomical and business assistance, and most importantly, marketing and export services to get the coffee into the hands of international buyers. They also rolled out an organic certification program several years back, though this lot was not brought in as certified. The processing site sits at 2000 meters above sea level, and members farm coffee as high as 2200 meters. We found that this lot of Geta Bore excels at a wide range of roasts. The coffee shows nice acidic impressions when kept to light roast levels. Balanced sweetness and bittering chocolate roast flavors find harmony with fruited top notes at Full City.

The Chichupak cooperative is located in a village of the same name, taking its name from a plant native to the region that is used to make soap ("Chupak" means "soap"). This area of Baja Verapaz is home to an indigenous community of subsistance farmers, coffee being the primary crop. This tight knit group of farmers formed an a cooperative alliance in the early 1980's, banding together resources to build a communal coffee processing site, complete with wet mill, fermentation tanks, raised drying beds and patio space. Chichupak is almost smack dab in the middle of Guatemala, not a region we've bought from historically. The climate and altitude are favorable to growing coffee, the latter spanning a range of 1600 to 2000 meters above sea level. We found this lot from Chichupak to have impressive balance at a wide range of roasts, along with fruited accents, and moderate fruited brightness. Not only is it versatile in roast application, but it excelled as both brewed coffee and espresso too. We haven't visited the coop, and the photos in this review are from various other trips to Guatemalan coffee farms.	\N	\N	https://www.sweetmarias.com/roasted-coffee-guatemala-coban-chichupak-coop-8128.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:41

Maria Elena Castro and son Luis Salazar opened their micro mill, Beneficio Monte Brisas, back in 2011 after years of delivering their coffee cherry to other mills and cooperatives. Maria Elena's farm, Finca La Salaca, sits at 1750 meters above sea level on the lush mountainous slopes of Zarcero in Costa Rica's famed West Valley growing region. The Pacific is the major influence in the West Valley with sprawling views of Naranjo and Alajuela readily available across it. Finca Salaca is planted with a lot of Villalobos varietal, some Villa Sarchi, and Caturra mixed in. This is a separation of Villa Sarchi, which is a natural mutation of Bourbon known for shorter stature ("dwarf"), high yield, and great cup potential - especially when grown at high altitudes. The Monte Brisas mill is incredibly clean and well cared for, and feels a bit like a museum with all of its meticulously maintained older machinery! The coffee is mechanically washed on a Desacafe machine and sun dried on raised beds adjacent to the wet mill. Leaving that fruit mucilage intact instead of washing it away is the hallmark of honey process coffee. This lot, however, is what some call "semi-washed", or "white honey", which is the Costa Rican equivalent of a fully washed coffee. The demucilager machine is calibrated to remove as much fruit as possible. Then the coffee is soaked for a short period to help wash away some of the remaining fruit. Without fermentation, there is still a very thin layer of fruit intact. This means the coffee looks a little darker when roasting it, and a much higher instance of chaff than the typical fully washed/fermented coffee.

The Gitwe washing station is located in Rwanda's southern Nyamasheke District. We started buying this coffee back in 2018, and actually, after tasting a sample on an origin trip that year, rearranged our travel plans to make sure we saw the site! (It's actually very close to Gatare - another coffee we buy - so fitting it into the drive wasn't too difficult). They've made quite a few improvements to their washing station since that first visit, investing in a water filtration system, and storage system unlike any we've seen in Rwanda. Gitwe sits at roughly 1800 meters above sea level, and the farms of the 800 out growers who deliver their coffee to Gitwe are situated between 1800 and 2000 meters. Gitwe produces both wet and dry process coffees, and have ample fermentation tanks and patio space to handle incoming coffee during the harvest peak. This is a fully washed lot, and a top scoring coffee from this first Rwandan container. Check out Tom's video of coffee production at the Gitwe washing station.

City to Full City.	This Maracaturra cultivar selection comes from Cafetalera Finca Buenos Aires based out of the town of Ocotal. The Maracaturra cultivar is a large bean variety of coffee, a cross between Caturra and the so-called "Elephant Bean", Maragogype. It seems to be grown mostly in Nicaragua although I have found nice examples in El Salvador too. Buenos Aires starts 1200 meters above sea level, stretching as high as 1500 meters on the mountain slope. This coffee is wet processed, which means that the whole cherry is mechanically separated from the coffee seed, and then the sticky layer of mucilage is broken down and removed using overnight wet fermentation. This tends to produce higher acidity levels, and often a cleaner, more clear set of cup flavors all around. Maracturra can be tricky to roast due to the enormous bean size requiring a little extra time to develop the inside of the bean. If you have the ability to control heat on your roaster, we've had luck extending the beginning roast leg before 1st crack in order to produce a little more roast consistency from the inside out.	Farm Gate	I enjoy this coffee most at City-City+, which goes for most Maracaturras, really. Sure, the sweetness is more developed a shade darker, but I find that it's pretty easy to round off top notes with too much roast. At City, the brew has characteristics that are tea-like, and delicate, atop refined sweetness, and bright acidity. The dry fragrance has a smell of green tea, along with toasted marshmallow, and a spritz of citrus. The wet aroma shows strength in sweetness, honey smells come up in volume, with a hints of pistachio confection, and light herbal notes. The cup profile has a light and airy quality, moderate sweetness, and relatively complex considering region. There's a nice base sweetness that works to pull together top note hints of Assam tea, marzipan, orange zest, and spearmint. The sweetness reminds me of semi-refined sugars (like "Sucanat") fading to bittersweet flavor of burnt sugar candies in the finish. Internal roast development can be difficult to achieve with Maracaturras because of the large screen size. For a light City roast, try roasting try pulling as soon as the rolling snaps come to a close. A few latent snaps are fine. Pull too early, and you might taste a little grassiness in the profile from internal underdevelopment. There's a fine line between too light and too dark, but I think this coffee is well worth the risk! City+ roasts are also delicious, but any darker will yield a cup focused around sweetness/bittersweetness, rather than the higher toned complexity found at light levels.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/nicaragua-buenos-aires-maracaturra-7949.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:50

Monte Libano is a farm owned by the same family who run Buenos Aires, Acopio Suyatal, and Finca La Laguna. This is an all Caturra separation from the 1350 meter farm, and we were initially impressed by the clean sweetness found in the middle roast range, an impression solidified after cupping darker roasts upon arrival. The past couple of years they've planted other cultivars as well including the large bean Maracaturra, and Gesha too, and hopefully we'll have an opportunity to taste coffee from those new plantings this season. Monte Libano is milled at the Buenos Aires mill in Ocotal, where all of the farms are being processed for export. They're doing all sorts of processing experiments at Buenos Aires, and are outfitted with raised beds, covered and uncovered patios, color sorting machines, and newer dry milling equipment to catch defects and separate by bean size. This particular lot is wet processed consisting of overnight fermentation, "washing" with fresh water in long channels using wooden paddles to remove the remaining fruit from the seed. All of the 1st qualities are first dried on raised African beds for the first few days, and then finished on patios (6 - 8 days total).	Farm Gate	Monte Libano has base sweetness of unrefined sugars and core bittering tones across a wide range of roasts, showing some subtle nuance for Nicaragua. City+ is a good starting point with this coffee, where bittering cocoa flavors find balance against the raw sugar sweetness. Aromatically, nutty notes are enveloped by smells of bittersweet cocoa powder, and mild sugars. Brewing City+ and Full City roasts brings out bittersweet chocolate and opens up to hints of walnut, a muted fruit note, like dried apple slices. While there is more than sweet and bittering flavors at work here, those are the characteristics that define the cup, and different levels of roast development do little to knock the two out of balance. Full City+ roasts promise hefty bittering roast flavors like cacao nib and licorice root, kept in check all the while by a dense layer of pungent burned sugar sweetness. Mild mannered brightness and cocoa character also make this a great espresso option.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/nicaragua-dipilto-monte-libano-7944.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:54
297	Nicaragua Maracaturra Los Medios	87	July 2024 Arrival	Dipilto, Nueva Segovia	Wet Process (Washed)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City	30	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Maracaturra	SHG	.5 d/300gr, 16-19 Screen	Delectable sweetness and delicate top note accents, with notes of caramelized creme brûlée, dulce de leche, caramel flan, with a dash of ginger powder, tart orange, and tannic black tea. City to Full City. Good for espresso.	Cafetalera Buenos Aires has offered us a "small" bean Maracaturra selection from their farms. I have quotes around 'small' because it's still on the larger end of the coffee bean size spectrum. (The range is purported to be 16 to 18 screen, measured in 1/64", but I think you will find the occasional smaller/larger exception on both sides of that range). What does this mean in the cup? We found this delicious Maracturra example had hefty sweetness and body, with the bright acidity and delicate top notes of our other Maracaturra's. The Buenos Aires' farms are mostly in Dipilto, and range in altitude from 1200 to 1600 meters above sea level. The Maracaturra cultivar is a large bean variety of coffee, a cross between Caturra and the so-called "Elephant Bean", Maragogype. It seems to be grown mostly in Nicaragua although I have found nice examples in El Salvador too. Buenos Aires is a rather low farm compared to other origins we buy, with this lot coming from about 1200 meters. This coffee is wet processed, which means that the whole cherry is mechanically separated from the coffee seed, and then the sticky layer of mucilage is broken down and removed using overnight wet fermentation. Maracturra can be tricky to roast due to the enormous bean size requiring a little extra time to develop the inside of the bean. Los Medios is a slightly smaller size than standard Maracaturra, but still a factor to consider when roasting. If you have the ability to control heat on your roaster, try a "slow and low" approach, slightly extending the beginning roast leg before 1st crack in order to produce a little more roast consistency from the inside out.	Farm Gate	While this Maracaturra selection is made up of the medium-sized beans, there's no half-measures in the cup. It has some of the delicate aromatic aspects of our other Maracaturra coffees, with an underlay of deep sweetness, medium body, and moderately acidic brilliance. The fragrance had a scent of raw sugars that, when adding hot water, bloomed to deep caramel tones, and a hint of dried green herbs. This year's lot presented juicy mouthfeel, though not a lot in the way of fruit flavors. There were some mild citrus notes at City that fed into the acidic impression, but the cup profiles were more along the lines of brown sugars. Light and medium roasts showed delectable sweetness like raw brown sugars, dulce de leche caramel, and a lactic aspect that came off like caramel flan. Top notes work their way into view as the cup cools, and included the aforementioned citrus notes, like lemon, and tart orange, played off tannic black tea notes, and an aromatic hint of powdered ginger. My Full City roast produced weighty chocolate roast flavors, accented by hints of raisin, baked apple, and spice. I had incredible espresso results pulling shots after 5 days rest, lasting bittersweet chocolate flavors, like high % cacao bar, with a muted hint of dried coconut and raisin.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/nicaragua-maracaturra-los-medios-7950.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:41:57

Deeper roasts pull out more of a dark cocoa cup with weighty body. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Ojo de Agua is a farm managed by the folks at Cafetalera Buenos Aires, one of Sweet Maria's main suppliers of Nicaraguan coffee for many years now. Each farm they have is a sight to behold. All of their farms are planted beneath a dense forest canopy. The coffee plants obviously well-managed, and there's a clear segregation of the different cultivars they grow (Caturra, Java, and Maracaturra mostly), making the harvesting of lot separations quite easy for farm workers. This lot is all Caturra, a mutation of Bourbon that occurred in Brazil in the mid 1930s, but was planted in South and Central America mostly in the 1950s. Ojo de Agua sits at roughly 1500 meters above sea level, a moderately high altitude for Nicaragua. The shade canopy really helps to slow the rate of cherry maturation too, increasing seed density, and ultimately, leading to a higher probability of sweetness and acidity in the cup.	Farm Gate	Grinding the light roasts brought up a malt note in the sweetness, with mild impressions of malted milk milk chocolate, candied nut, and cocoa powder. The wet aroma pulls out a smells of caramel and pistachio, along with a note of toffee almond. Full City roast also showed promising bittersweetness that bodes well in the brew. At City+, the cup sweetness has a complex toasted sugar flavor at City+, with hints of vanilla wafer, and praline almond. Low tones are moderate in the light roast, and offer a bittersweet layer in the finish, along with dry spice hints, and a barley tea note that informs the acidic impression. Full City and Full City+ roasts are inky with dark chocolate flavors, flourless torte, Baking cocoa in the aftertaste. A great option for chocolate-forward espresso shots on its own, or as a body/bittersweet ingredient in a blend.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/nicaragua-ojo-de-agua-7942.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:42:01
299	Peru Huabal Perlamayo	87	November 2023 Arrival	Perlamayo, Huabal	Wet Process (Washed)	Patio Sun-dried	City to Full City	30	69 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Caturra, Typica, Bourbon	SHB EP	.5 d/300gr, 16-18 Screen	Raw sugars, hazelnut and walnut accents, tangy lime hint, and an aromatic herbal note that reminded me of Maragogype and Parainema varieties. Dark roasts build hefty bittersweets. City to Full City. Good for espresso.	This "Perlamayo" lot is comprised of the coffees from several small-holder farmers in the town of Perlamayo within the greater District of Huabal. Altitude range in SF is 1800 to 1900 meters above sea level and cultivars grown are typically Caturra, with some Typica and Bourbon mixed in. Farmers in Perlamayo typically have less than half a hectare of coffee planted, which is much less than what you see in the other towns we've bought coffee from (San Francisco, Alto Pirias, etc). This is a fully washed coffee, wet processed by the farmers who then deliver their coffee in dry parchment (the green bean with the thin parchment layer still intact) to a warehouse in Cajamarca where it is graded and purchased. The group who set up this buying operation are working to register all the farmers they buy from in order to help isolate different quality tiers, but also be able to issue the initial payments and any quality premiums themselves, something that was lacking when they were buying through more traditional avenues. It doesn't help that the roads leading to Huabal and within the district are much more rustic than some of their neighbors, limiting access to farmers in this region.	Farm Gate	The dry fragrance displayed clean sweetness and toasted nut, with hints of cocoa and dried apple. A cane sugar smell pushed through accents of pistachio and spices in the wet aroma, along with a note of candied walnut. At City roast the coffee shows a convincing raw sugar base sweetness, with hazelnut and walnut accent notes that you'd expect given the aromatics. Initially, the cup flavors had a green herbal aspect that marked the aroma, and reminded me of Maragogype, or Parainema, the Honduran variety. The cup was lightly fruited with notes of apple and tangy lime that emerged as the coffee cooled down a bit. Full City roasts had a flavor of bittersweet cocoa, with a swirl of sweetened almond milk. My espresso shots at two days rest had a chocolate-hazelnut flavor that, along with a note of smoked chocolate, lingered in the long finish.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/peru-huabal-perlamayo-7816.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:42:38

Brown sugar, cinnamon-spiced apple, dried apricot, pleasantly bittering finish of citrus rind and cocoa. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	"Mikan" is an association in Jaen, who are collaborating with farmers in the towns of La Cordillera and La Cascarilla to help improve coffee quality in order to get a better price. They do this by holding workshops with farmers on optimal harvest and post-harvest practices, such as when to pick ripe cherries, and how to be consistent when processing coffee at the home mills. Farms in these two towns span an altitude range of 1700 to 1900 meters above sea level, and you see a mix of cultivars. The coffee is processed by the farmers using small machinery to remove the outer cherry skins, then fermenting for around 2 days before moving to indoor drying rooms for around 3 weeks (often referred to as "solar dryers", and similar to how coffee is dried in Colombia). Once dried to roughly 10-11% moisture content, the coffee is moved to the dry mill of an exporter we work with in Peru, who then remove the parchment layer and grade the coffee. They also evaluate each individual lot delivery, an important step in quality separation. This is a way of ensuring that farmers are compensated for their best quality without losing it to a blend.	Farm Gate	The sweet fragrance is accented by dark sugars, dried apple, with a savory-spice note of cinnamon toast, and hint of pistachios. Pouring hot water brought out a delicious smelling note of cooked cherry pie filling with candied nuts, and notes of almond confections. The cup shows impressive clarity, and an assemblage of top note accents bring depth of flavor to this rather sweet Peruvian brew. Brown sugar notes are central to the light and middle roasts, with highlights of cinnamon-spiced apple, and dried apricot. There's some really nice cocoa bittering at City+ and Full City roast levels that leads to a pleasantly bittering finish, accented by hints of citrus rind, and dark cocoa. Full City was as dark as we roasted Mikan, but based on body and bittersweetness alone, I have no hesitation recommending this coffee as espresso, or dark roasting for that matter. You should expect some of the fruits to come through, especially as espresso. I count that as a net positive myself!	https://www.sweetmarias.com/peru-jaen-alianza-mikan-7818.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:42:42

The coffees of Central America are go-to ingredients for us when we want to bring body and sweetness to an espresso blend. So it stands to reason that blending all Central American coffees would only enhance those aspects even more, right? After tasting this trio all blended together, the answer is a resounding "yes". "Altiplano" is the word we are using for high plains, not to be confused with THE Altiplano in South America. From the Cordillera Central in Costa Rica, to the Los Cuchumatanes in Guatemala, to the Los Arados mountains in Nicaragua, we bring in a wide variety of coffees with unique cup profile, and that all work extremely well as espresso. Blended together, the resulting cup or espresso has balance, and with an acidity that is controlled by roast development. This blend was built with espresso in mind, and includes all wet-process coffees that offer balanced flavors, body, and at least one has moderate acidity too. Roasting to City+ will have the highest tones in the cup, though we prefer at least Full City in our espresso machine. Full City/Full City+ will produce a more "classic" espresso profile with chocolate roast pungency, deep sweetness, and a fruited acidity that to me has an orange zest-like quality (though the cup is far from "fruity"). Altiplano is seasonal blend, and we'll be rotating new coffees in as they become available, updating the review when necessary.

Once there was "Classic Italian," our espresso blend to set the benchmark for traditional European-style espresso. It was a blend based on quality Brazil coffees, with a touch of aromatic Central American coffee to add a grace note to the cup, and it had a small percentage of premium robusta in it for crema, mouthfeel, and to add traditional flavors found on the continent. But times change and tastes change. Espresso culture is much less Euro-centric, and for good reason. While Italy gave us espresso, the general quality of your average espresso there can be quite poor. Don't even talk about coffee in France. The big brands in Europe are largely run by multi-nationals who keep a close watch on price, and gleefully buy lower quality green coffee if they can save .01 Euro. The privates follow suit, in order to compete. Of course, there are many exceptions, but the darker roast styles, well into 2nd crack, to cover up the use of low quality green coffee ... well, that is NOT something to emulate. For Sweet Maria's, espresso has never been our "dumping ground" for coffees we can't sell, old lots, or ones with mild defect. It's been a program where we have dedicated time, focus in cupping, and roast testing. With this in mind, we want to start over again, and offer New Classic, a somewhat silly name, an oxymoron, and overused ... but it says what I want it to say: Here is the new benchmark espresso with sweet-bittersweet balance, body, crema, and finesse, the core definition of the espresso beverage, and defines it in the established West Coast espresso style (clean, bright notes) without the burden of European espresso conventions. In other words, no robusta! Oh, and No obsessive interest in crema! (You can produce buckets of crema in espresso and still have a very mediocre-tasting cup. What ... do you make espresso just to look at the beautiful crema? No dummy, you make it to drink it!). New Classic generally involves Brazil as one of the base ingredients, with washed Centrals and South American coffees bolstering sweetness, and of course, chocolate roast tone. Blend ingredients will change with what's in season, but we always shoot for flavor continuity.

This is a sweet but punchy little cup, and roasted fairly light it is a shock to the palette, but has great body and a smooth, sweet, stunning aftertaste. The joke behind the name: I imagine a fancy roaster charming a client in the cupping room, effusing about their "Master Roaster" and "Master Blender" and "Master Cupper", all in the trade for decades of course. Then I imagine the scene in their warehouse where hired apes rip open bags of green coffee and randomly hurl handfulls into the hopper for roasting. In other words, there's a lot of BS in the coffee trade, and blending is NOT really a noble art ...it's done to save cost and disguise coffee defects 80% of the time. The Irony? I have never worked so hard to develop a blend as this one, designed to cup well at a full range of "espresso" roasts, and developed as a pre-blend (all coffees roasted together to same degree of roast). Am I going to tell you exactly what is in it? No! I am feeling a bit snobby today! Espresso Monkey has become our signature blend for some reason or other, perhaps because it is a true standard that we have sought to maintain for so long, and that we put such nice coffees into it.

City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	The Gitwe washing station is located in Rwanda's southern Nyamasheke District. We started buying this coffee back in 2018, and actually, after tasting a sample on an origin trip that year, rearranged our travel plans to make sure we saw the site! (It's actually very close to Gatare - another coffee we buy - so fitting it into the drive wasn't too difficult). They've made quite a few improvements to their washing station since that first visit, investing in a water filtration system, and storage system unlike any we've seen in Rwanda. Gitwe sits at roughly 1800 meters above sea level, and the farms of the 800 out growers who deliver their coffee to Gitwe are situated between 1800 and 2000 meters. Gitwe produces honeys, like this lot, as well as wet and dry process coffees, and have ample fermentation tanks and patio space to handle incoming coffee during the harvest peak. This honey lot has a very nice interplay of caramels sweetness, bright acidity, and thick body. We also happen to have a wet process lot on the site, so a unique opportunity to taste a single source coffee processed different ways. Check out Tom's video of coffee production at the Gitwe washing station.	Farm Gate	In terms of fruit flavors that can come with honey processing, this lot from the Gitwe mill is on the milder side. My top roasts were in the City-City+ roast range, where a sturdy sweet base layer is produced that still leaves plenty of space for acidity to shine. The fragrance of the ground coffee gave off a scent of light caramels and honey, whereas the wet aroma had more of a nougat-y smell, and was potently sweet. The brewed coffee had flavor notes of darker caramels, coffee candies (like "Nips" brand of hard candies), and same faint bittering in the mouthfeel that brought to mind Dutch cocoa powder. The cup acidity had a citrus element, that along with the sweet notes, brought out a sweetly tangy profile of caramel custard with lemon sauce, and an earthy aspect of yellow tea in the finish. Dark roasts build approachable bittersweetness and body, and tamp down on the vibrant notes. It'll make an excellent single origin espresso, or work well for a bittersweet/body base ingredient in an espresso blend.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/rwanda-gitwe-murarambwe-honey-7842.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:43:05

Very versatile light to dark. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	The washing station Kageyo lies in the highlands surrounding the southeastern shores of Lake Kivu in Rwanda's Ngororero district. It's not too far from another washing we purchase coffee from, Gitesi, and is a coffee that hits a similar quality target. In fact, Kageyo was the 1st place winner of Rwanda's Cup of Excellence coffee competition in 2011. But other than winning this competition, the cooperative struggled during this time, taking out a bank loan to build a new wet mill that low harvests and insufficient mill capacity made it difficult to repay. A private exporter stepped in to help out, purchasing the wet mill, but leaving the farmer cooperative structure intact. This has benefited the coop in that they are absolved of their loan debt, have a direct connection with the specialty market through a well-established export partner, and retain a supply chain that is completely transparent. The wet mill recently underwent renovation, expanding their milling infrastructure in order to increase their production capabilities. We helped support this project directly, as well as donated a portion of our Kageyo sales to help see the effort through (so thanks to you too!). The association is made up of small farmers situated around this 2000 meter wet mill, and coffee in the region is some of the highest altitudes we see in all of Rwanda. Like much of Rwanda, the coffee planted in the region is Bourbon variety. It's worth mentioning that this should not be confused with "Kigeyo", a name that you may recognize from other cafe menus.	Farm Gate	Kageyo's a versatile Rwanda, no doubt about it. Light roasts have tea-like qualities, brightly spiced, whereas medium and dark roasts are equal parts raw sugar sweetness and complex cocoa flavors, with a little something extra up top. The dry fragrance and wet aroma had smells of cinnamon streusel dessert, caramelized sugars, milk chocolate, and almond marzipan. In the brewed coffee, the cup sweetness brought out flavors of raw sugar. Accent notes had a very nice tea-like aspect, mouth-refreshing, and brought spiced aspects to the front, like cardamom powder, and more woody spices such as cinnamon sticks. City+ roasts had a nice mix of cocoa and caramel, with dashes of baking spice, and sharp orange rind. The acidity level can be tamed with roast, and bittersweetness bolstered, which keeps our espresso recommendation on the table. Our Full City roast brewed up deep chocolatey profiles, like dark chocolate covered raisin, bittersweet torte, and the smokiness of roasted cacao nibs in the long finish.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/rwanda-kivu-kageyo-7836.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:43:08

Brown sugar and spice notes linger in the dry fragrance, molasses cookie, dried ginger, and malted grains. Adding hot water frames a saturated sweet aroma of caramel flan, honey graham cracker, and cinnamon. Light roasts brew up attractive caramel sweetness at a wide roast range, accented by aromatic spices overhead. Dried apple and orange hints bring a quiet, fruity accent to the brew, and highlight a vivid acidic impression. My Full City roast pulled out bittersweet chocolates, and cinnamon, along with some latent dark fruit accents. The darker roasts help temper the vivid brightness some, but not altogether.

City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	The coffee from Tumba washing station was on my radar for years before we first bought it almost a decade ago. When I first tasted it, the sweetness and bright acidic snap in the cup made a great impression. But at the time I noticed varied quality from one cup to the next, and a lack of consistency can mean problems in the processing. For a coffee buyer, it signifies that what you taste now might not be what you get upon importation. The backstory at the time was Tumba Station was a private processing wet mill that had 2 owners with very different ideas of quality and how to run a mill. Fast forward a few years, and we found ourselves purchasing Tumba for the first time under a very different light. A local teacher in the Tumba area for which the mill is named, had taken over all aspects, and the coffee was consistent in every cup ... and amazingly good! Venustre Mugraneza, the teacher, is esteemed in the local community and has been systematically improving the mill. The best coffee cherries (those that make up this lot) are dried in a special area of raised beds and receive focused handpicking by the farmers. Tumba is situated at 1825 meters in the Rulindo district, where we've also sourced the excellent Cocatu Cooperative lots.	Farm Gate	The dry fragrance is laced with cane sugar sweetness and spiced hints, with fruit accents that are slight, and a tea-like sparkle. There's a real depth of sweetness that blossoms in the wet aroma, a complex mix of brown sugars, and fragrant raw honey, along with a hint of berry, and a slightly floral aspect. The brewed coffee is substantially sweet, without losing the aromatic characteristics smelled up front. The sweetness is marked by notes of cane sugar aspects, with a lively mix of citrus and berry notes, like pomegranate, and the zing of raspberry lemonade. The finish at City and City+ displays delicate suggestions of loose leaf black tea, and like aromatic English Breakfast. Tumba shows a very nice level of acidity when roasted light, with aspects of black tea and a spritz of orange that bring out a brisk, mouth cleansing finish. Tumba's sweetness holds up to darker roast levels, and my Full City roast showed a layer of dark fruit, like plum, beneath the cocoa roast flavors. Dark roasts of Tumba have always been a favorite single origin espresso around here: bittersweet, chocolate-laden, heavy body, with an aroma of fruit and spice...so nice!	https://www.sweetmarias.com/rwanda-rulindo-tumba-8145.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:43:15

310	Sumatra Giling-Anaerobic Aulia Kahfi	88	August 2024 Arrival	Bebesen, Aceh	Anaerobic Fermentation, then Wet Hulled (Giling Basah)	Covered Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	20	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Abyssinia, Ateng, Tim Tim	Grade 1	1 d/300gr, 16-19 Screen - expect some bug holes, broken beans, very dark and uneven coloring; par for the course for giling basah!	Dark fruits and herbal-accented sweetness bring depth of flavor to this earth toned cup. Rice syrup, fresh tarragon, dried prune, winey ripe fruits, rustic cacao, and woodsy cedar aroma. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This coffee comes from a quality-savvy coffee collector named Aulia who buys in the districts of Bebesen and Kute Panang, in Sumatra's Aceh province. Farms in these regions tend to span an altitude range from about 1300 to 1600 meters and are planted in older, long berry types (you'll see the long, canoe shaped beans) Abysinnia, Ateng and Tim Tim. In the scheme of things, Aulia's operation is quite small. He usually buys a few bags at a time, and then processes coffee with family at home. With small scale comes the capability for a high level of quality management, which he puts into all of the different process technics he employs. This coffee is an anaerobic-wet hulled coffee, a hybrid of sorts that constructs incredibly complex cup flavors. The first step of this hybrid coffee process involves storing the whole cherry in a sealed environment, which is where the name "anaerobic" comes from (though not entirely correct, since there is still oxygen inside the barrels or bags used). While the cherry is fermenting in this closed system, the CO2 that is created during the process builds into a high pressure environment, that supposedly allows for a more controlled fermentation process. One thing's for sure, most of the anaerobic fermented coffees we've tried skew toward outlier fruit flavors, winey in character, and with lower acidity. This seems to be the case here, though tempered by the wet hulled/giling basah step that follows. The cherry and fruit are peeled straight from the fermentation tanks, and then dried the rest of the way on raised beds. This step of the process is what constructs the earth-toned flavors we tend to associate with Sumatra, and certainly what popularized the coffees from this region. But here we have a unique hybrid process that brings out the best of both worlds. A cup of fruit and foresty flavors, big body, low toned, and complex through and through.	Farm Gate	For an anaerobic coffee, I found this lot from Aulia to be on the milder side of the fruit spectrum in that the flavors never tasted over the top, or wild with ferment. Instead, hints of dark berry and fruit brought depth of flavor to the herbal-accented sweetness, and earth toned cup. The dry fragrance had a sweet scent of palm sugar and baked fruit, fresh herbs, and a bit of roast intensity in my darker roast. The wet aroma was sweetly complex, with caramelized sugar smells, and foresty green accents. Fruit flavors shadow a complex earthy sweetness that is herbal toned, and bittersweet. It has a lot of what we've come to expect from Sumatran coffee. City+ roasts show notes of brown rice syrup accented by fresh tarragon and rosemary, dried prune, and winey ripe fruits in the aftertaste. At Full City+, the fruit flavors are mostly traded out for resonant low tones of dark chocolate, and rustic cacao, along with smokey wisps of cedar chips. Juicy hints add a little something extra to the heavy bittersweet flavors, though muted in comparison to our City+ roast. Body was thick and viscous across our recommended roast range, and the acidity level was pleasantly mild as well.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sumatra-giling-anaerobic-aulia-kahfi-8020.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:44:53
311	Sumatra Lintong Mutu Batak	87	September 2024 Arrival	Lintong Nihuta	Wet Hulled (Giling Basah)	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to French	20	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	0	Typica, Jember, S-795, Lini-S	Grade 1	1+ d/300gr, 15-18 screen - expect some broca damage, split beans, quakers...typical of Sumatran coffee	Earth-toned sweetness, rustic molasses and sorghum syrup, pungent bittersweetness, foresty notes of peat, and scorched cedar, woody incense, inky thick body, and licorice hint. City+ to French. Good for espresso.	"Mutu Batak" comes from the growing region of Lintong in Northern Sumatra near the shores of Lake Toba. Lintong coffees are from Sumatra, the island that is politically and geographically part of Indonesia. Lintong Nihota is the town that has become synonymous with the entire southern part of Lake Toba area. Lake Toba defines the landscape of the area, the largest volcanic crater lake in the world, and the result of the largest volcanic event on earth in the last 25 million years! It is huge, and the coffees from the north and eastern shores are quite different from the Lintong coffees. Lintong coffees are farmed by the Batak peoples that are the indigenous tribe that works the coffee in this area. This coffee is part of a somewhat unlikely joint venture between a Costa Rican farmer and an Indonesian coffee exporter. Together, they see to it that the coffee is carefully selected and separated by quality, then double hand-picked during the milling process. This coffee works at a wide range of roasts, with bittersweetness and the complex forest and herbal notes of the Lintong terroir. It might go against common sense, but I find Sumatra's like this more complex in the lighter roasts than in the usual darker roasts they receive (no lighter than City+). The main reason is that many commercial roasters use color and surface texture as indicators of roast level. They roast coffee until the bean looks attractive. With a Sumatra like this, you will mostly likely hit 2nd crack at the point where the surface texture and variegated bean color evens out, and (I think) you may have gone too far at that point. This is a Sumatran coffee, meaning you should expect damage like insect holes, broken beans, and more. That said, this is much cleaner prep than your average Gr.1 Mandheling, which is not only visually noticeable, but has a positive impact on cup quality too.	\N	Mutu Batak is a potent smelling coffee, with rustic-tinged sweetness from front to back. The dry grounds give off sweet date sugar notes, accented by hints of earthy spices, and pipe tobacco. In the wet aroma, intense rustic sweetness presses on, with an overlay of fresh green herbal notes, like tarragon and sage, and intense bittersweetness that pulls the outlier aspects closer to the ground. City+ and Full City roasts show plenty of earthy appeal in the cup, with molasses and sorghum-like sweetness, contemplative foresty flavors, and indications of peat/scotch and aromatic woody incense. Bittering low tones build momentum with deeper roast development, and is especially the case in Full City/Full City+ roasts, which I fully endorse. Some of that earth-toned sweetness is still very much present with 2nd snaps, adding some interest to the opaque roast tones, and accents of licorice root, and charred cedar come through in the aftertaste. We recommend letting this coffee rest for at least 48 hours.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sumatra-lintong-mutu-batak-8098.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:44:56
312	Sumatra Wet Hulled Kerinci Coop	87	August 2024 Arrival	Gunung Tujuh, Kerinci	Wet Hulled (Giling Basah)	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	50	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Ateng, Jember, Tim Tim	Grade 1	1+ d/300gr, 15-18 Screen - physical defects come with the territory, but this is a very nice sort in the context of other Grade 1 Sumatra's!	Impressive wet hulled coffee with intense cup flavors, sweetness of sorghum syrup, caramel glazed nuts, earth-toned accents, fresh green herbs, bittersweet roast tones and a hint of fruit. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This coffee comes from a coffee farmer's cooperative, "Koerintji Barokah Bersama", in the Gunung Tujuh area, a higher elevation coffee zone around Mount Kerinci. The cooperative serves about 450 farmers in the area who are divided into 24 farmer groups, 4 of which are specifically women's farmer groups. Many of the farms in this area are planted in older Typica types and benefit from the high slopes, situated between 1400 - 1500 meters above sea level. This is a wet hulled coffee, also known as "giling basah". This is the typical process method in Sumatra and involves removing the parchment layer while the coffee is still wet, exposing it to the elements well before the coffee is stable. When handled well during the drying phase (like this coffee), this rustic process method yields an earth-toned, bodied cup, with mild acidity and syrupy sweetness, and the green bean taking on a dark green hue unlike wet or dry process coffees from other producing countries. Having roasted this coffee, I'm very pleased with the uniformity of roast color and the minimal quakers from underripe coffee making it through. Giling basah - and Sumatran coffee in general - has a reputation for being riddled with defects even at "Grade 1" standard. Our "Appearance" category score is a little on the high side as a sort of worse case scenario, even though the green I inspected looked much cleaner than this. I saw minimal broca damage for Sumatra (this is not a Latin American coffee), only a few unripe beans, and some broken beans. It's no Grade 1 Ethiopian coffee, but far better than your average Grade 1 Sumatra.	Farm Gate	This coffee from Kerinci once again proves that not all wet hulled coffees are equal. It offers some of the foresty flavors that wet hulled coffees are known for, but without getting too rustic. In fact, our brew tests pulled out resonant bittersweetness in the cup, and even hints of fruit! The fragrance and aroma produce notes of dark toffee and molasses, herbaceous accents, aromatic fir, and a note of dried prune. Roasting Sumatra light isn't always recommended, but this coffee excelled in both dark and lighter City+ roasts. In fact, I really enjoy this coffee at the lighter end of the roast spectrum, and was surprised by some of the aromatic flavors in that range. The level of sweetness was impressive, sorghum syrup, caramel glazed nuts, along with a range of top notes like brown spice, fresh green herbs, earthy peet, and cooked fruit lurking in the background. My Full City was deep-toned, and pungent, and it produced such intense and delicious flavor profiles! The cup was thick-bodied, loaded with chocolate roast flavors, and a slight grape note that came through as it cooled off a little. The bittersweetness found at Full City and beyond will work wonders as espresso, and also lends itself to an espresso blend as a body/bittersweet base component.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sumatra-wet-hulled-kerinci-coop-8016.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:00

You could say it works great on all gears! City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Coffee and cycling have enjoyed a decades long connection that likely stretches back well before the early days of coffee company-sponsored cycling events (see FAEMA professional cycling team of the late 1960's). Whether it's coffee's burst of caffeine energy before the ride, or winding down with an espresso at the end of a tour, coffee has been a sort of touchstone for bringing together cyclists at 2-wheeled events and casual excursions. Our 10 Speed Blend celebrates the classic lines of the 10 Speed bicycle. Celebrated for it's agile footprint and versatility, it quickly became the steed of choice for commuter cyclists and racers alike. With versatility at the front of our minds, the 10 Speed Blend uses coffees that can be roasted light or dark, and that show well under any brew method or as espresso. You could say it's a blend that works great in any gear! Using coffees from similar altitudes aids in roast consistency, something that can be especially tricky when roasting pre-blended coffee light. We will mostly use wet process coffee, but this first iteration has a honey process from Burundi that hit the quality target in the bullseye. We're looking to regions in East Africa and Central America for dense coffees that are classic-toned, balanced sweet and bittering flavors, and that carry some acidity too. The latter part can be snappy at City, or rounded and bittersweet at Full City. Don't be afraid to shift through a few different roat level to find the perfect cruising gear that suits your taste! Check out our roasting guidance here.	Farm Gate	The Sweet Maria's 10 Speed Blend celebrates the classic lines and versatility of the 10 Speed bicycle that's rightfully earned legendary status in cycling. This blend is a mix of coffees that show classic-toned flavors bittersweet and bright, and is extremely versatile in roasting and brewing methods, including espresso. No matter the roast level, you can expect a syrupy sweetness in the cup that rounds out bright citrus in the light roast, and bittering low tones the closer you take it to Full City+. We tested several roast batches when putting this blend together, and were taken a back by the array of raw sugar flavors, even at 2nd Crack! This is due in part to the dense coffees chosen, as well as the prevalence of highly regarded varieties, like Bourbon, found in some of the coffee origins. Look for hints of fruit and spice, and balanced base flavors that work wonders in most any brew method, including as a base for milk drinks. And as espresso, the 10 Speed Blend is a home run! Intensely aromatic, satiny mouthfeel, with a confluence of tangy dark chocolate and citric bite, and a bittersweetness that hangs around in the long finish. Like the bike, I guess you could say our 10 Speed Blend works great on all gears!	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-marias-10-speed-blend-7834.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:03

Flavors of high % cacao bar, rich chocolate truffles, syrupy dark chocolate, hints of prune, lemon peel, and praline almond. Full City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	The coffees of Central America are go-to ingredients for us when we want to bring body and sweetness to an espresso blend. So it stands to reason that blending all Central American coffees would only enhance those aspects even more, right? After tasting this trio all blended together, the answer is a resounding "yes". "Altiplano" is the word we are using for high plains, not to be confused with THE Altiplano in South America. From the Cordillera Central in Costa Rica, to the Los Cuchumatanes in Guatemala, to the Los Arados mountains in Nicaragua, we bring in a wide variety of coffees with unique cup profile, and that all work extremely well as espresso. Blended together, the resulting cup or espresso has balance, and with an acidity that is controlled by roast development. This blend was built with espresso in mind, and includes all wet-process coffees that offer balanced flavors, body, and at least one has moderate acidity too. Roasting to City+ will have the highest tones in the cup, though we prefer at least Full City in our espresso machine. Full City/Full City+ will produce a more "classic" espresso profile with chocolate roast pungency, deep sweetness, and a fruited acidity that to me has an orange zest-like quality (though the cup is far from "fruity"). Altiplano is seasonal blend, and we'll be rotating new coffees in as they become available, updating the review when necessary.	Sweet Maria's Blends	We're rebooting another round of the ever popular Altiplano blend. This particular lot is balanced and bittersweet, with such a creamy mouthfeel as espresso. There's a hint of fruit to be found too, though far from a fruity blend. While intended for espresso, I think full immersion brewing will do well to highlight body, not to mention the syrup, bittersweet cup profile. Middle roasts are chocolatey through and through, the dry fragrance marked by smells of cocoa powder and a hint of dried date, the wet aroma more of a dark chocolate and molasses smell that's incredibly potent. As espresso, Full City shots have this dark, syrupy aspect underneath that comes off like a dark chocolate sundae topping, a flavor that really hangs around in the aftertaste. It also has a tangy aspect that fits in like shaved lemon peel on the rim of your demitasse (so '90's!). What I think you'll mostly find here are shots gushing with syrupy, thick chocolate bittersweetness, and flavor notes of high % cacao-chocolate bars, rich chocolate truffles, and dark chocolate syrup. I'm particularly fond of shorter espresso shots myself, my favorite results using an 18 gram basket, yielding around 20-25 grams of espresso over the course of roughly 25 seconds. The shots have such a creamy mouthfeel, allowing the rich chocolatey flavors to linger on your tongue. The flavors are incredibly intense, as if shouting all at once, finding space and identity in the middle and finish. The aftertaste is just so long and contemplative, and flavor notes hint at raisin, praline almond, 'cocoa crispies', Baker's chocolate, and so much more.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-maria-s-altiplano-blend.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:07
315	Sweet Maria's Decaf Espresso "Donkey" Blend	85	All current-new crop	\N	Varies	\N	As with all decafs, remember they roast faster and have the propensity to get away from you and end up darker than you expected. So attend to the roaster and stop the roast manually if possible to get it just right. Roast preference with espresso is up to you. I personally prefer the lighter N.

Perfect on its own, and stands up to milk too! Full City to a light Vienna is recommended.	People have requested that we offer a pre-blended espresso, a decaf counterpart to the Espresso Monkey blend. Working under the codename of the "Donkey Blend" (don't ask how all these ridiculous names started ---I think it was George's fault) we came up with this. It is intended to be used several ways. As an all-decaf espresso blend I wanted it to work well under a wide variety of roasting conditions, in terms of both lighter Northern Italian type espresso roasts (the equivalent of a Full City to Vienna Roast) and the darker Southern Italian type roast (roasted to a French roast). I also wanted a good espresso from both air and drum roasters, and I wanted good crema. This is a lot to ask from a decaf, but I think this blend works very well. While origin tastes are muted in decafs, I think the bittersweet roast tastes from this blend are very good. My second focus was having the blend not have too much character so that it can be used as a base blend for a "low-caf" espresso. This means it should work well as 50-75% of your blend where you add other caffeinated coffees to give more aromatics and flavor: my choice would be a Ethiopian Harar, or a Central American (see our Blending Basics article for more). Why do we call this Donkey Blend? Frankly, I can't remember .. it just is...

316	Sweet Maria's Espresso Monkey Blend	88	All current-new crop	Africa, South America, Central America	Wet and Dry Process	Patio and Raised Bed Sun-Dried	I like this blend best when the roast is stopped just as second crack becomes rapid, and shows no sign of slowing down. Actually, I like it a lot lighter than that too! I don't like this roasted to a dark, dark roast stage, Full French or Italian. This is because Brazilian coffees become ashy and began to bitter when roasted extremely dark. I believe strongly in a 36+ hour resting period before use for espresso extraction! It wont kill you to use it sooner... but you might notice sharp unpleasant notes.	n/a	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Varies	Top Grade	15-18 screen	We blend this for body, balanced between high and low tones, fruited-chocolate roast flavors, and slightly rustic fruited accent notes. Our roast goal is in the beginning stages of 2nd crack ... we never "let it roll", so we recommend FC+ to light Vienna roast.	A longtime favorite espresso blend intended solely for pump and piston type espresso extraction. This is a sweet but punchy little cup, and roasted fairly light it is a shock to the palette, but has great body and a smooth, sweet, stunning aftertaste. The joke behind the name: I imagine a fancy roaster charming a client in the cupping room, effusing about their "Master Roaster" and "Master Blender" and "Master Cupper", all in the trade for decades of course. Then I imagine the scene in their warehouse where hired apes rip open bags of green coffee and randomly hurl handfulls into the hopper for roasting. In other words, there's a lot of BS in the coffee trade, and blending is NOT really a noble art ...it's done to save cost and disguise coffee defects 80% of the time. The Irony? I have never worked so hard to develop a blend as this one, designed to cup well at a full range of "espresso" roasts, and developed as a pre-blend (all coffees roasted together to same degree of roast). Am I going to tell you exactly what is in it? No! I am feeling a bit snobby today! Espresso Monkey has become our signature blend for some reason or other, perhaps because it is a true standard that we have sought to maintain for so long, and that we put such nice coffees into it.	Farm Gate, Sweet Maria's Blends	We blend this for body, balanced between high and low tones, chocolate roast flavors, and slightly rustic fruited accent notes. Those are our goals, that is the "spirit" behind the blend, and we check it to make sure it meets those targets. This blend has historically been geared toward Full City to Full City+, without letting 2nd crack "roll" too long. The current ingredients include some dry process coffee from Africa and South America, which lend to big body and some fruited cup characteristics. There's also a nominal amount of a washed Central American coffee that helps round out the sweetness in the cup or shot.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-maria-s-espresso-monkey-blend.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:14

Best with resting 48-72 hours. Full City to Full City+.	Our latest version of "Ethiopiques 2.0" is a blend of wet and dry processed Ethiopias that melds the body and fruit tones of these particular ingredients, with the bittersweet chocolatey flavors that come with darker roasting. For those who appreciate both, it's a match made in heaven, and I think you'll find the dark-toned fruits to be quite complimentary to the moderate level of cocoa roast flavors that comes with Full City to Full City+ roasts. The current blend (August 2023) is 1/3 wet process Ethiopia, which brought a slight floral aroma to the chocolatey low tones and fruits that find equal footing. That said, the wet process ingredient was chosen based on body and sweetness more than anything else. Full City is a good starting point, or roughly 30F post 1st Crack if your roaster has a thermocouple. You also achieve a fairly uniform roast coloring at this roast level, but being mostly dry process coffees, expect some variation. Full City+ roasts will tone down the fruit quite a bit, and is where I think this Ethiopian blend works for milk drinks. But at Full City, the fruits are a little too wild for a cappuccino or latte in my opinion.	Farm Gate, Sweet Maria's Blends	Version 2.0 was blended with espresso in mind, and what a lovely espresso it makes. (After all, it is a blend of Ethiopian coffees!) I try not to judge espresso by how it looks, but I felt fairly certain this year's version was bound to be a knockout before taking my first sip. Watching the velvety textured liquor fold into itself when pulling a shot, I found myself transfixed by the visual parallels to pouring chocolate syrup! For espresso, I'm sticking with Full City to Full City+ roast levels as the recommended range for this blend, the outer edge allowing for just a few 2nd snaps. Anything lighter than this and you wind up with shockingly bright acidity. This might suit some, but I found it to be far too puckering given the wet process component that's been added in (currently 1/3 washed, 2/3 natural). Right around Full City (around 30F post 1st C) is where I find a nice mixture of bittersweetness and fruit paired in the shot, berry and softer stone fruit notes, and some tangy fruit flavors as well. There's even a hint of florals at this roast level that is mostly lost when taken to 2nd Crack. This makes an incredibly creamy-textured shot, with a thick layer of brown-speckled, golden crema crowning the liquid. But flavor's what's important, and 2.0 is so different than any other blend we have. Fruit flavors are experienced through a bittersweet lens, dark fruit notes are jammy and sweet, rolled into robust bittersweet flavors that have a lasting impact on the finish Stepping out a little farther on the flavor branch, I pick up on notes of dried blueberry covered in dark chocolate, cherry liqueur, raspberry laced chocolate truffles, and creamy bittersweet ganache. Full City+ (FC+) flattens out the acidity, but berry notes still manage to leave an impression amidst bittering roast tones that bring out more of a roasted cacao nib bittering quality. I recommend letting your roast rest for at least 24 hours to off-gas, but this blend might find it's peak closer to 48-72 hours post-roast.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-maria-s-ethiopiques-version-2-0-6113.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:18
318	Sweet Maria's Liquid Amber Espresso Blend	86	\N	\N	Varies	\N	I advocate a Northern Italian style roast (lighter espresso roast, really a French roast, stopped 30-45 seconds into 2nd crack), but the blend works very well at the darker Southern Italian style roast (a full French roast actually, at the peak of a rapid 2nd crack). Either way, get this into 2nd crack and allow proper resting that espresso demands: 48+ hours is best. This blend works great in air and drum roast machines and I developed it test-roasting on both. If you notice a tingly "baking soda effect" in your mouth, then the coffee could use more rest.	\N	\N	\N	0	Varies	\N	1 d/300gr, 17-19 Screen - defect count will vary, but we're being on the safe side since the Monsoon coffee can have bug holes.

Caramel sweetness turns pleasingly pungent with 2nd snaps; spice, cacao and semi-sweet chocolate, savory notes, long aftertaste. Monsoon coffee and a small percentage of Robusta add crema and body.

With a full list of coffees from Indonesia and Ethiopia, the timing for this blend was right to blend a fruity dry process Ethiopia and earthy wet-huleled Sumatra, decaffeinated at the Swiss Water Process ("SWP") plant in Vancouver, BC. The goal of the blend was to produce a Moka Java version that showed big body, brooding bittersweetness when roasted dark, and with some dark fruit accent notes that can be tempered (or not) with roast development. The coffees that went into this blend really hit the mark. The "original" Moka Java was comprised of two of the earliest coffees to be exported from Yemen and Java, hence the name. I can honestly say, it's a resounding success and is hard to pinpoint as 'decaf' coffee at all! (It's worth noting that the high score should be taken in context of other decafs). This is an incredibly forgiving blend where bittersweetness is a prominent feature at a very wide range of roast levels.	Farm Gate, Decaf, Sweet Maria's Blends	This blend of Ethiopian and Indonesian decafs is versatile, and very sweet at many roast levels. We tested City+ and Full City for this review and found the flavors held enticing top notes suspended in a very bittersweet flavor base. The more developed roast presented a lot darker in both flavor and color, and had a more pungent flavors of dark cocoa and burnt sugars, without pulling out any ashy notes. The coffee lets off an interesting fragrance and aromatic profile for decaf, from blackstrap molasses, to fruit leather sweetness, to doughy bread notes. City+ roasts make an excellent cup, and I don't think I would know it's decaf if no one told me! There is chocolate bittersweetness meshed with hints of berry, and prune, that add a nice juicy aspect. The earthy flavors from the Indonesian coffees add to the depth of flavor, but were overall fairly restrained in both of my roasts. In terms of acidity, it's not a bright cup, but not flat either. The subtle acidic impression that graced my City+ roast was a welcome aspect, especially for decaf!  My darker roast amplified opaque bittering cocoa notes, and brought out some pungent burnt sugars. Keep in mind that with decaf, it's easy to go too dark, so erring on the light side of your intended target is ideal to start, then adjust as needed.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-marias-moka-java-swp-decaf-7550.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:25

Full City+ to Vienna. Good for espresso.	Moka Kadir is a staple on our list most of the year...or at least as long as we have Yemeni coffee in stock! The components are all dry-processed coffees from Yemen, Ethiopia and small amount of Brazilian coffee. Between these three, we find an espresso on the rustic and exotic side, some fruit-forward character and earth-toned bittersweetness in full effect. It's great as espresso in the Full City+ to Vienna roast territory, and the mix of dry process coffees handle well in the roaster, regardless of the difference in density when sticking to the recommended roast range. Full City roasts may show some variance, and I recommend taking your roasts closer to Full City+ development which will help afford roast evenness. Slowly ramping up the heat will also help in this effort if your roaster has manual heat control. For those without (like a popper for example), try slowing your roast by slightly overloading the chamber and I wouldn't stop the roast development until you're on the heels of 2nd snaps. (I "overload" the roast chamber by first turning the popper on, then adding coffee until just after it stops moving - it should only take a few seconds to get the coffee moving again). A balance of sweet and bittersweet flavors are achieved with rustic layers woven in both fruited and earthy. Moka Kadir has incredibly velvety body too that works very well in milk drinks.	Farm Gate, Sweet Maria's Blends	The dry fragrance of Full City+ roasts has a strong rustic sweetness like palm and date sugars, along with smokey cocoa, and a sweet fruited underlay. The wet aroma sticks close to this, fruited sweetness building in the steam, and pungent bittersweetness is strengthened as well. The cup is the culmination of all the intense aromatics, and more. Dense, thick body adds to the sense of an almost chewy cup character! Full City+ roasts show a bittersweetness of smoky cacao nib and mesquite notes, offset by sweet molasses and chocolate syrup, that all do well to ground the wilder cup characteristics. Espresso is where this blend really shows best, with an underpinning of rich chocolate layers, high % cacao up front, roasted nibs in the middle, and an unsweetened baking type chocolate flavor that lingers long into the finish. Dried fruit notes are played up in the cup, due in large part to the Ethiopian component that finds footing in the flavor profile. Notes of slab apricot and plum offer fruited counterpoints to the bold, bittersweet low tones, and are distilled down to an opaque fruited chocolate flavor. The top notes in the finish are leathery, herbal, fruited, earthy, and of course, bittersweet. The mouthfeel of Full City+ and Vienna roasts as espresso is velvety, and offers a delicious espresso base for milk drinks. Moka Kadir is made up of all dry process ingredients, so you can expect quite a bit of chaff during roasting. It seems to really benefit from an extra day of rest too, which allows some of the more disparate flavors to come together. Try degassing for 48 hours before drinking if you can wait...3+ days even with Full City+ roasts.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-marias-moka-kadir-blend-4463.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:28
321	Sweet Maria's New Classic Espresso	88	\N	\N	Varies	\N	We recommend a range of roasts from FC, FC+ to light Vienna. That means just ending the roast just before 2nd crack (FC), a few snaps into 2nd crack (FC+), or as second crack begins to gain some momentum (Vienna)	\N	\N	\N	1	Varies	Top Grade	.6 d/300gr, 15-18 Screen	A classic, balanced espresso, but without the baggage of the old world espresso conventions ...and without robusta! The espresso has balanced bittersweet notes, thick and opaque body, almond and chocolate roast flavors, hints of spiced fruit in aroma. Full City+ and beyond.	Once there was "Classic Italian," our espresso blend to set the benchmark for traditional European-style espresso. It was a blend based on quality Brazil coffees, with a touch of aromatic Central American coffee to add a grace note to the cup, and it had a small percentage of premium robusta in it for crema, mouthfeel, and to add traditional flavors found on the continent. But times change and tastes change. Espresso culture is much less Euro-centric, and for good reason. While Italy gave us espresso, the general quality of your average espresso there can be quite poor. Don't even talk about coffee in France. The big brands in Europe are largely run by multi-nationals who keep a close watch on price, and gleefully buy lower quality green coffee if they can save .01 Euro. The privates follow suit, in order to compete. Of course, there are many exceptions, but the darker roast styles, well into 2nd crack, to cover up the use of low quality green coffee ... well, that is NOT something to emulate. For Sweet Maria's, espresso has never been our "dumping ground" for coffees we can't sell, old lots, or ones with mild defect. It's been a program where we have dedicated time, focus in cupping, and roast testing. With this in mind, we want to start over again, and offer New Classic, a somewhat silly name, an oxymoron, and overused ... but it says what I want it to say: Here is the new benchmark espresso with sweet-bittersweet balance, body, crema, and finesse, the core definition of the espresso beverage, and defines it in the established West Coast espresso style (clean, bright notes) without the burden of European espresso conventions. In other words, no robusta! Oh, and No obsessive interest in crema! (You can produce buckets of crema in espresso and still have a very mediocre-tasting cup. What ... do you make espresso just to look at the beautiful crema? No dummy, you make it to drink it!). New Classic generally involves Brazil as one of the base ingredients, with washed Centrals and South American coffees bolstering sweetness, and of course, chocolate roast tone. Blend ingredients will change with what's in season, but we always shoot for flavor continuity.	Farm Gate, Sweet Maria's Blends	While this blend is designed primarily for a Full City roast, stopping the roast before 2nd crack, it also works well with a darker roast treatment. It does not have the extreme brightness that have been the trademark of some of our Espresso Workshop blends; it is a bit more restrained in it's overall demeanor. The cup has a balance between sweet and bittersweet flavors, moderate bright accent, soft traces of fruit, body and depth. The Full City roasts have a very sweet aromatic side, lightly fruited with plum and a hint of spice (cinnamon, cardamom). Darker roasts tend toward chocolate laced with dark fruit tones, in both aroma and cup flavor. Both have a firm, opaque body, which only helps strengthen the creamy dark chocolate flavors, along with toasted almond roast notes as the espresso cools. In the aftertaste, dark fruits accent a very sweet finish for espresso. There are whole spice hints, like anise, too, which with the fruited accent made me think of fruit-flavored licorice. Of course, results vary with how the espresso machine and grinder are set up. We use 8.5 bars of pressure at the head, with 202-205 degrees water temperature (measured at the head) to start, dropping to about 198. At higher temperatures, it's a more aggressive espresso with a bittersweet edge and well-suited to milk drinks.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-maria-s-new-classic-espresso.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:32
322	Sweet Marias Cordillera Central SWP Decaf	87	July 2024 Arrival	Central America	Swiss Water Process	\N	City to Full City+	70	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	Bourbon, Caturra, Catuai, Catimor, Typica	SHB EP	.8 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen - some broken, misshapen beans from decaffeination	Remarkably sweet decaf with bright accents, caramel and raw sugars, apple top note, accents of tree nuts and rye, barley malt, and low-toned chocolatey base flavors. City to Full City+. Great decaf espresso!	Our Cordillera Central decaf blend includes a rotating cast of coffees from countries straddling the vast mountain ranges of Central America. It's the decaf version of our popular Altiplano blend, that we keep in stock most of the year. Like Altiplano, this blend is put together with balance in mind, choosing coffees that are fresh, offer sweetness and moderate acidity, and are capable of dense chocolate roast flavors when roasted dark. We favor coffees that work well as brewed coffee and espresso, and that show well at a variety of roast levels, so that we get a decaf that hits those same marks. Swiss Water decaf in Vancouver BC are a key ingredient in that last part. Their patented chemical-free water process method is one of the gentler methods out there, and we've found that the coffees we have processed by Swiss come back tasting great. All decaffeination methods impact flavor to some extent, but the Swiss process seems to leaves some of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. Send off a fruity coffee, get a fruity decaf in return. Or in this case, a sweet decaf with balanced low tones and modest acidity!	Farm Gate, Decaf	When grinding the coffee, I picked up on a very nice interplay of sweet-savory notes, like buckwheat pancake with maple syrup, with a nice dark cocoa note. Pouring hot water on the coffee brought out a sweet molasses note, along with a slightly smokey note of caramelized sugar, and puffed rice cereal. The cup is remarkably sweet for decaf, with bright accents, and captures a lot of the flavor profiles and cup characteristics we find of non-decaf Central American coffees. City+ roasts have tasty bittering notes at the edges of caramel and raw sugars, with an apple top note that quickly fades to hints of tree nuts/pistachio and rye in the aftertaste. Full City roasts are more low toned but still very sweet, and offers hints of barley malt, with chocolatey finishing flavors, like Ghirardelli hot cocoa. This makes a standout decaf espresso, with a bittersweet base note that's perfect for a cappuccino, or to enjoy solo.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sweet-marias-cordillera-central-swp-decaf-7981.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:35

Approachable bittersweetness is followed by notes of mollases, dried fruit, sticky fig, and an oaky aromatic hint of a barrel-aged coffee. City+ to Full City+.	The Acacia Hills coffee estates is located on the southeastern side of the picturesque Mount Oldeani, a volcano that hugs the edge of Ngororero Conservation aera. Topping out around 1900 meters above sea level, Acacia Hills estate is supposedly the highest altitude coffee farm in this region. The estate was established in the 1960's, but coffee has been growing here much longer. Coffee was initially planted here by a group of Germans in the 1930's, a vestige of colonialist settlements in the region. In 2007, the farm was purchased as a joint venture by local Tanzanian coffee farmers, Leon and Aideen Christianakis, and a coffee roaster in Portland, Mark Stell. Since taking ownership, the group has focused on improving the quality through farm renovation, new plantings, soil analysis, and refining the post harvest processes. This is a dry process coffee, which means the seeds are dried with the cherry still intact. This can lead to fruity flavors in the cup, and characteristics like body, and low levels of acidity. This lot displayed lots of rustic fruits in our assessment, and with very nice bittersweetness that makes it well-suited for middle to dark roast levels.	Farm Gate	This wild and wooly natural is heavily weighted in rustic sweetness and fruit accents. The fragrance of the ground coffee showed notes of molasses, and the pungent side of burnt caramel, with dried fruit accents mixed in. The wet aroma showed stronger fruit impressions that came through like cooked berry filling at City+ roast level, with rustic accents, and a hint of black tea. This coffee has a moderate level of sweetness in the range of roasts we tasted (as dark as Full City, 35F past 1st C), and cools to complex dry process flavors of rustic fruits and sugars. The flavor matrix in the hot cup had an approachable bittersweetness that tempered the fruit flavors a bit. The coffee cools to notes of dried fruit, sticky fig, and an aromatic hint of something like oak-aged spirits. My darkest roast that was very close to 2nd Crack showed a surprising level of sweetness, with moderate roast bittering, and dark fruit hints in the finish.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/tanzania-dry-process-acacia-hills-ab-7896.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:39

Caramel, dark cocoa, walnut, lime zest, and green herbal notes on the nose. City to Full City+.	This lot comes from a producer group in Sabelu Village, Dukurai, within Letefoho municipality. The group consists of 10 members who ae delivering whole coffee cherry to a central processing station called Daurfusu. The cherry collection and new wet mill where the coffee is handled is run by the same Farmpro group who we've bought Timor Leste coffee from the last few years, and they only continue to refine their process. Farmers in this area are growing a mix of cultivars, mostly Timor Hybrid and Typica, and in the case of Sabelu, at altitudes of 1500 to 1600 meters above sea level. The arrival of washed Timor Leste coffees comes at a time when Central American options are starting to thin out, and in terms of flavor, they work quite well as replacement! But they also just shine on their own, offering a flavor profile that's uniquely positioned within the coffee producing regions of Southeast Asia and Indonesia.	Farm Gate	At City roast level, the ground coffee had a scent of sweetened cocoa powder, and raw sugars, with smells of baked goods, and subtle hints of fruit. There was an apple hint in the wet aroma, though it took a backseat to more dominant bittersweet smells, and accents of caramel and cocoa. The cup flavors were in line with the smells, and showed very nice clarity. It's a versatile coffee in terms of roast, and offers bright cup flavors when roasted light, or deep low-toned roast notes when taken into 2nd Cracks (we roasted as dark as Full City+). My City roast was moderately sweet, with notes of caramel and light brown sugar, accented by hints of walnut, canned pumpkin, tangy lime zest, and a green herbal note on the nose. of My Full City+ brew was very bittersweet, with smokey wood chips, and fennel note on the nose. It will do fine as espresso, though  I think medium body makes it more well suited for milk drinks rather than solo shots.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/timor-leste-sabelu-7859.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:42

It's a really nice sort for Yemen, however you may see a few quakers, broken beans and minor bug holes.	Strong spiced character in the cup, a potpourri of woody whole spices like cardamom, cinnamon stick, and clove, accents of cooked pear, raw brown sugar, and rustic bittersweets. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This exceptional regional Yemeni blend, "Sanani", is from small-holder farmers in the broader Sana'a region. This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the group, she has worked to implement practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, the lack of underripe coffee and shipping in Ecotact liners has really benefitted the resulting cup quality. During their long history in the coffee trade they've forged longstanding connections with farming groups in several growing regions, and because of these connections, are able to buy coffee in a more direct way. This lot is made up of coffee from roughly 300 farmers Sana'a, who on average have 1000 trees planted on less than 1/2 hectare of land. Altitude is extremely high, starting around 2000 meters and stretching upwards of 2400 meters above sea level. Read our interview with Fatoum Mouslot from 2020.	Farm Gate	This dry process lot from Sanani is our final Yemeni coffee of the season, and while I want to say it leaves us on a "high note" (because it does!), I think "spiced fruit" note is more accurate in terms of brewing. The fragrance of the ground coffee has intense fruit and spice notes, like dried apricot and apple, with sweet spices of clove and cardamom. The wet aroma had a dried berry hint, with something like a sweet-spiced Chai, with its loose-leaf black tea base, and spices such as cardamom, anise, and coriander. The cup flavors follow suit, showing strong spiced character up and down the different roast levels. City+ roasts brewed a particularly intriguing profile of cooked apples and pears, raw brown sugars, and complex spice notes that brought to mind holiday cookies, and spice cake. The cup profile opens up as it cools, with potpourri of cardamom, cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. The finish had rustic fruit flavors of natural dried fruit, and some woody whole spice accents, like cinnamon sticks. You can really drive up the deep, chocolate-toned flavors with darker roasting, and Sanani will pair well with milk too, and make a standout single-origin espresso.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/yemen-mokha-sanani-7892.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:45

Middle roasts develop a bodied coffee, bittersweet flavors expand to notes of Brazil nut, goat milk caramels, malted grains, cocoa-dusted pumpkin seeds, rhubarb, dried date, and tobacco. City+ to French. Good for espresso.	Sharqui Haraz, (which we've also referred to as "Harasi", and "Bani Haraz"), is a coffee from the sub district of Al Sharqui, adjacent to Ismaili, and in fact they merge to some degree. If you travel west on the road from the capital Sana'a, toward Hodeidah on the Red Sea, you will pass quite close to Haraz, as I did when traveling to Yemen a several years back. I visited an amazing zone within Haraz with towering, ancient stone villages, like castles precariously perched atop steep precipice. It was incredibly dramatic. All the coffee here is grown on terraces, since little land exists that is flat, except for the lowland deserts. The coffee is hauled up remarkably steep slopes, carried in small amounts, most often by donkey. This lot was secured through Fatoum Muslot, who took over the family coffee business started by her father back in the 1950s. They've long exported Yemeni coffee, and since Fatoum has started managing the operations, she has worked to implement quality-focused practices such as more stringent hand sorting and using Ecotact storage bags in order to directly affect their coffee's overall quality. Roughly 140 farmers are contributing to this regional blend, and the altitude of the farms hover around 2200 meters above sea level. We're quite pleased with the physical condition of both coffees we bought from Fatoum this year, and shipping in Ecotact has really helped with the long transit times from Yemen. Read our interview with Fatoum Mouslot from 2020.	Farm Gate	Sharqui Haraz is focused around rustic sweetness, body, earthy accents and subtle fruit tones. The sweetness in the dry fragrance is unrefined and earthy, with a smokey bittersweetness behind it, along with notes of sorghum, molasses, and pumpkin seeds. The wet aroma is complex with layers of sweet-to-savory notes, like palm sugar, toasted barley tea, and sweet squash. Bani Haraz should be roasted to City+ minimum to develop sweetness, and Full City is a good starting point for those looking to bring out a low toned profile. Middle roast levels build out a bittersweet chocolate core that expands to include creamy Brazil nut, earthy cacao, leaving room for top notes of fruit, and an aromatic sweet note that brought to mind caramels made with goat milk. The cooling coffee produces flavor aspects of cocoa-dusted pumpkin seeds, chocolate malted grains, and dried apricot and date. I picked up on a slight acidic impression at City+ roast level too, with rhubarb, and a tobacco hint. My darkest Full City+ roast pushed bittersweet cocoa roast tones to their limit, with wisps of sweet smoke (like applewood chips), and hint of anise. This viscous coffee also makes an intense shot of espresso on its own, as well as a bittersweet/body ingredient for espresso blending. No matter how you roast it, this coffee will benefit from rest after roasting, and I really think 48 to 72 hours is best, especially for darker roasts.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/yemen-sharqui-haraz-7890.html	\N	2025-01-20 08:45:49

Aromatic raw sugars, buttery caramel, cinnamon stick, currant tea, walnut, and ribbons of bittersweet chocolate. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	This lot is a blend made up from the coffees of five different small producers with coffee farms just outside Buesaco town, in Colombia's Nariño Department. We put this blend together after cupping several samples from the region, the goal being to separate out any coffees that hit our quality target. Each individual lot was on the small side to bring in on their own, however together, they totaled 31 bags. This year the exporter we work with opened their own buying warehouse in town in order to have a more direct hand in how the coffee and payments are being managed. It was perhaps the most competitive year for buying in Colombia that we've seen in over a decade, with the local price soaring to nearly double what it was last year. When the margin between base price and microlot price narrows to such a degree, farmers have less incentive to separate out their best coffee for a meager second payment. So this year we paid higher prices than ever in order to maintain those longstanding relationships and get the coffees we want. Farms are typically planted in Caturra and Variedad Colombia (F4 and F6 types), grown at altitudes between 1700 and 2100 meters.	Farm Gate	At City roast level, the dry fragrance is enmeshed with a scent of caramelized sugar, honey and almond. With a shade more roast development the 'caramelized' scent is even more compelling, especially in the wetted grounds where the bittersweetness is accented by notes of caramel crumble, and dark toffee. Light roasts offer approachable flavors that are well defined, and carry some brightness too. There's depth to the sweetness in the cup. Flavor profiles of raw cane sugar are aromatic like panela/piloncillo, with some buttery caramel. Notes of walnut and cocoa powder in the finish lead to some light bittering on the tongue. The acidity level is moderate, with tea-like aspects leading into lightly aromatic notes of cinnamon stick, and black currant tea. Taking the roast to Full City ties on a ribbon of cacao/chocolate bar, bittersweet and to some degree dominant, though accompanied by a subtle hint of dark berry too. Full City roasts made decadent single origin espresso shots, patching together deep chocolate roast flavors with dark fruit accents.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/colombia-narino-buesaco-8151.html	\N	2025-01-27 00:18:51.182741-07

Darker roasts pulled chocolaty espresso shots, syrupy, with a raspberry bite. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	"Bambú" is the name of the farm plot this coffee was harvested from, identified by the proliferation of bamboo trees around it. It's part of a larger farm, owned and operated by Joiner Alvarado and his family. When Joiner got his start in coffee, he would sell his harvest to other mills in nearby towns. After saving enough money he decided to step out on his own and build his own micro mill called "Joicafe". Joiners farm is 40 hectares overall, spans an altitude range of 1650 to 2000 meters above sea level, and is planted in Caturra, and Catuaí. This lot is what's called "White Honey" in Costa Rica, which is really their equivalent of fully washed coffee, though there is no fermentation stage. The coffee is pulped using a mechanical demucilager calibrated to remove most of the outer fruit and sticky mucilage in one fell swoop. The coffee seeds are then moved to patios where it drives over the course of 1-2 weeks. Even though it isn't a full honey process coffee, it still produced more chaff than your typical wet process lot. It's just something to keep an eye on between batches, vaccuuming as needed.	Farm Gate	Grinding a City roast released a sweet scent of spiced sugars, accented by pungent molasses, with fruited hints coming up from behind things, like sticky dates, and fig butter with cinnamon. The wet aroma had some rustic date sugar notes, along with raisin. The cup is right in line with the smells. A well-balanced bittering flavor is accented by spiced fruits, like apple pie filling made with cinnamon and brown sugar. As the coffee cooled there was a pleasantly acetic quality that brought a complex wine note to the profile, propped up by juicy mouthfeel. Full City roasts brewed up a thick-bodied, chocolaty coffee with a lot less fruit. I preferred my City/City+ roasts for brewed coffee, and darker roasts of Full City, or beyond, for espresso. I pulled a shot at 3 days rest and enjoyed the syrupy mouthfeel of my Full City roast. A distilled flavor of dark chocolate bar was intense, and gave way to pulpy accents, and a note of tart raspberry brought some bite.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/costa-rica-chirripo-lote-bambu-7990.html	\N	2025-01-27 00:18:55.249988-07

City to Full City.	Hambela Buliye is one of a few coffee processing sites managed by Kedir and Esmael Hassan, who run Hambela Dabaye, and others as well. We first visited Hambela Buliye site in 2019, and have been buying it ever since. They only produce dry process coffee at Hambela Buliye, and are receiving coffee from 200 registered farmers, as well as from their own "Buliye" farm nearby. They are mostly buying coffee from farmers in the surrounding kebeles of Buliye, Wamana, Borticha, Dari Rogicha and Dabaye. What's interesting about having a site that only produces naturals, is that you're not tied to a water source for processing coffee, and can build them very high in the mountain. Buliye rests in a very high altitude zone of around 2150-2200 meters above sea level, and the farms are planted at a wider range. On our last visit in 2024, we noticed there wasn't a lot of direct sunlight on the beds, which led to longer drying times of around 3-4 weeks. This year's coffee is as fruited as ever, and displays very nice level of acidity too, not always the case with natural processed coffee.	Farm Gate	Fruit notes are bountiful in the dry fragrance, with potent stone fruits and tropicals right up front, peach, apricot, mango, and wild berry notes too. The wet crust is aromatic and sweet. Cooked fruit and berry notes lead to wisps of peach cobbler, and an amazing perfumed floral fruit note that comes off a little like freesia flowers in the steam. This cup has plump berry flavors in light and medium roasts that are delicious, with a ripe berry/floral quality that adds a delicate aspect to the brewed coffee. Cranberry notes never left the front of my mind when drinking this coffee, tartly sweet, and mouth refreshing. This coffee has a lot to offer as it cools, accent notes of blueberry, orange, mango, fruit salad...and more! I suppose there's a rustic side too, being a natural and all, but the fruits are surprisingly clean, with a bit of brightness that helps convey structure to some of the wilder flavors. Berry notes don't let up at Full City either. My Full City roast was 32F beyond the start of 1st Crack. It brought out a hefty cocoa flavor that led right into notes of dried blueberry, and plum, and still wielded some perceived acidity. A note on espresso: If you're a fan of fruity espresso, Buliye is incredible again this year! (think chocolate and blueberry syrups swirled together, with inky texture, and a bright shot across the brow up front!). That said, I'm withholding the espresso recommendation from the coffee "Specs" tab and short description because I think it is too wild for the average espresso drinker.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-dry-process-guji-hambela-buliye-7998.html	\N	2025-01-27 00:18:58.423401-07
330	Mexico Organic Chiapas Los Nogales	86	September 2024 Arrival	Rancho Santa Rita, Montecristo de Guerrero	Wet Process (Washed)	Patio Sun-Dried	City+ to Full City+	26	69 Kg Bags	GrainPro Liner	false	Bourbon, Marsellesa, Typica	SHG	.6 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Flavors strike a nice balance between low-toned bittering and some surprising brightness. Chocolate-covered almonds, dark cocoa powder, green lime note, with bittering zest. City+ to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Los Nogales is a small 2 hectare farm located in Montecristo de Guerrero, Chiapas. The farm is managed by Jesus Alejandro Angel Perez. He grew up working the farmland with his grandparents, who gifted him a small plot when he turned 18. Los Nogales sits at 1525 meters above sea level, and is planted with Bourbon, Marsallesa, and Typica. Jesus processes his coffee on a small belt driven pulper at the farm. He ferments his coffee for 24 hours after pulping the fruit, and then double washes it to remove the sticky fruit mucilage before drying on tarps outside. His farm underwent organic certification, and is fully NOP Organic certified.	Organic/Fair Trade Cert.	There's a mild sweetness of unrefined sugars and roasted nuts in the dry fragrance, like toffee peanut, with something that comes off a bit 'green', and herby. The wetted grounds were accented by a sharp bittersweet side that was somewhere between the smell of dark cocoa and roasted nut shells. City+ is a good starting roast point for this coffee, where flavors strike a nice balance between low-toned bittering and some surprising brightness. The coffee profile had deep bittersweet chocolate notes, such as chocolate-covered almonds, and dark cocoa powder in the aftertaste. The acidity had a tangy lime note, with a bittering zested citrus peel accent. This is a coffee that will brew well using full immersion methods (like French Press, or Clever Dripper), accentuating tactile body and rounded flavors. It's also a coffee to consider for milk drinks.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/mexico-organic-chiapas-los-nogales-8078.html	\N	2025-01-27 00:19:01.987095-07
331	Roasted Espresso 1/7: Sweet Maria's 10 Speed Blend	\N	\N	Latin America, East Africa	Wet Process, and Honey Process	Patio and Raised Bed Sun-Dried	\N	\N	\N	Biotre Compostable Valve Bag	false	\N	\N	.4 d/300gr, 15-18 Screen	Roasted to City :  Low-toned coffee with a flash of acidity and a balanced dark chocolate sweetness. Good for espresso.	Coffee and cycling have enjoyed a decades long connection that likely stretches back well before the early days of coffee company-sponsored cycling events (see FAEMA professional cycling team of the late 1960's). Whether it's coffee's burst of caffeine energy before the ride, or winding down with an espresso at the end of a tour, coffee has been a sort of touchstone for bringing together cyclists at 2-wheeled events and casual excursions. Our 10 Speed Blend celebrates the classic lines of the 10 Speed bicycle. Celebrated for it's agile footprint and versatility, it quickly became the steed of choice for commuter cyclists and racers alike. With versatility at the front of our minds, the 10 Speed Blend uses coffees that can be roasted light or dark, and that show well under any brew method or as espresso. You could say it's a blend that works great in any gear! Using coffees from similar altitudes aids in roast consistency, something that can be especially tricky when roasting pre-blended coffee light. We will mostly use wet process coffee, but this first iteration has a honey process from Burundi that hit the quality target in the bullseye. We're looking to regions in East Africa and Central America for dense coffees that are classic-toned, balanced sweet and bittering flavors, and that carry some acidity too. The latter part can be snappy at City, or rounded and bittersweet at Full City. Don't be afraid to shift through a few different roat level to find the perfect cruising gear that suits your taste! Check out our roasting guidance here.	Farm Gate	\N	https://www.sweetmarias.com/roasted-coffee-sweet-marias-10-speed-blend-7834.html	\N	2025-01-27 00:19:05.087457-07
332	Rwanda Dry Process Nyamiyaga	90	December 2024 Arrival	Nyamiyaga, Ngoma, Kamonyi	Dry Process (Natural)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	30	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	true	Bourbon	A1	.2 d/300gr, 15-17 Screen	Fruit flavors are well supported by punctuated bittersweetness, with notes of rustic palm sugar leading to accents of cooked berries, winey grape, and dark cocoa bittering in the finish. City to Full City. Good for espresso.	The Nyamiyaga station is located in Nyamiyaga town, within the Kamonyi District of Rwanda's Southern Province. The coffee washing station serves almost 3000 farmers in the surrounding villages, most with less than 1 hectare of coffee. At just under 1500 meters, the milling site is at a much lower altitude than most of the coffee that comes in, many of the farms reaching above the 1800 meter mark. The station employs many grading techniques to separate out the top quality coffee, starting with the whole coffee cherry being submerged in tanks of water, and removing the low density coffee that floats to the top. The dry process coffee is then moved to raised drying tables where it will dry over the course of a few weeks. During this time, the cherry is turned by hand, and the workers continue to remove any coffee with physical defects they find along the way. All this care and attention results in a very uniform coffee for dry process, making it much easier to roast, as well as a very consistent brew.	Farm Gate	The ground coffee had a nice fragrant smell of blackberry sauce at City roast, with some hefty notes of toasted sugars, and dark spices. The overall sweetness was a lot more dense in the wet aroma, fruits took the shape of natural dried fruits, berry jams, and bittersweet roast tones really started to show in my darker Full City roast. A fruited profile is found, especially in our lighter roasts. Full City roasts still had some of the fruited dry process characteristics, but cocoa toned flavors were also a lot more punchy and made a lasting impression. At City roast level, flavor profiles have notes of cooked berries, like blackberry and blueberry, with a winey accent of fermented grape. Fruit flavors feel well supported by punctuated bittersweetness in the cup, like rustic palm sugar, and deeper cocoa tones that extend to the finish. At the risk of causing a bit of a fuss with the non-fruit crowd, I'm loving Nyamiyaga as espresso. It's so rich with bittersweet chocolate, like high % cacao bar, but has this juicy berry note that sort of splashes through midway through the sip. Full City is the minimum roast level for espresso, and I think it's best enjoyed solo, sans steamed milk. To be clear, you may want to look elsewhere if you're not a fan of fruited espresso shots. But if you're like me, you just may have found a new favorite!	https://www.sweetmarias.com/rwanda-dry-process-nyamiyaga-8167.html	\N	2025-01-27 00:19:08.45226-07
333	Sumatra Wet Process Kerinci Pendekar	87	August 2024 Arrival	Gunung Tujuh, Kerinci, Jambi Province	Wet Processed (Washed)	Patio Sun-Dried	City to Full City+	20	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	true	Ateng, Jember, Tim Tim, Typica	Grade 1	.6 d/300gr, 16-19 Screen	Sturdy bittersweetness is accented by hints of toasted sugars, vanilla bean, red fruit, condensed milk, chocolate malted grains, and herbal anise in the aftertaste. City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	Wet processed coffee is a little harder to come by in Sumatran than the traditional wet hulled style. Those two processes may sound very similar, but couldn't be farther from the truth. The wet process is typically associated with clean flavors, and more pronounced acidity, whereas wet hulling leads to the earthy, rustic flavors, and low acidity that Sumatra is known for. What happens when you remove the lens of rustic processing? This is a unique opportunity to find out. This coffee comes from Gunung Tujuh area, a higher elevation coffee zone around Mount Kerinci in Jambi Province. There's a cooperative of farmers that have banded together in this growing region, taking an interest in going beyond the traditional wet-hulled process, incorporating dry process, honey process and wet processing to their repertoire. We're calling it "Pendekar" - which translates to "warrior" - as it's a term of endearment members use for each other when someone does a really good job with a coffee (like improving their processing equipment, planting more coffee, building a greenhouse, etc.). This is their fully-washed coffee, meaning they are pulping, fermenting immediately and moving wet parchment straight to the drying beds after rinsing away the remaining fruit. It's a gentler process than wet hulled, and results in a cleaner flavor profile, almost no earth tones at all, and acidity that's normally lacking in Sumatran coffee. The farms in this area are planted in mostly Ateng (cross of Timor Hybrid and Bourbon) and benefit from the high slopes, situated between 1400 - 1500 meters above sea level.	Farm Gate	Ever wonder what Sumatran coffee tastes like without the affect of the traditional wet-hulled processing? Well, here's your chance to find out. This is a really good example of a washed Indonesian coffee, prominently sweet, with a nice level of acidity and top note accents. In a City+ roast the fragrance showed toffee-like sweet smells, with milder notes of toasted grain. The wet aroma brought out a bittersweet backdrop, with some sweetly caramelized sugars. Brewing a City+ roast yields foundational bittersweet notes of toasted sugars and Drinking cocoa, accented by vanilla bean, hints of sweetened condensed milk, and red fruit. Lighter roasts have a nice acidic impression that adds a bracing quality to the profile, atypical of Sumatran coffee. Sweet and bittering roast tones were neck-in-neck in both City+ and Full City roasts, with finishing flavors of chocolate malted grains, and anise. I brought one roast almost to 2nd Crack and was surprised by the level of sweetness that backed the intense low toned cocoa flavors. A rare opportunity to taste the local cultivar without the influence on flavor that traditional wet-hulled processing has.	https://www.sweetmarias.com/sumatra-wet-process-kerinci-pendekar-8017.html	\N	2025-01-27 00:19:11.543913-07

Blackberry, pomegranate molasses, cinnamon apple sauce, dried prune, fruity wine, and rum-like aroma. City to Full City.	This coffee is definitely of the "wild and wooly" variety, however, some balance is struck between core rustic sweetness and nuanced fruit notes from process method. It has the kind of fruit-forward, winey flavors that fans of anaerobic coffees should love. The dry fragrance is very sweet in the City-City+ roast range, and presents an underlying note of blackstrap molasses that lays out a nice background for contrasting hints of fermented fruits, and maraschino cherries. The wet aroma has a scent of rustic natural sweeteners (date sugar came to mind), with notes of berry crumble, and plum wine. The cup shows fruit flavors that are both sweet and winey, and carry a kind of complex fermented intensity. Body is a big part of the experience too, and acidity is on the low to mid-level, which actually works well in this context. The flavor profiles in my City+ roast touched on blackberry filling, tangy fruit wines, pomegranate molasses, cinnamon apple sauce, and a rum-like aroma in the nose. Full City roast pushed bittersweetness toward the front too, but still brewed fruit flavors of dried prune, and spice.	This coffee from Hacienda Sonora is part of a family operation that goes back five generations in Costa Rica's West Valley region. The Guardia family have farmed coffee here for more than 100 years, historically selling their harvest to large mills, as was the norm. That all changed in the late 90's with the micro-mill revolution that swept Costa Rica, and, seeing value in controlling their coffee quality through to export, the family erected their own small milling operation at their farm. Currently under the management of Diego Guardia, the farm have decided to move away from more water intensive process methods, favoring honey and dry process instead. This bag lot is "dry process", meaning the whole coffee cherries are laid to dry, rather than being removed from the green seed. This process method can impact the cup flavors and physical characteristics too. In the case of this coffee, it possesses fruit and wine-like notes, big body, no doubt tied to process method. The beans also look a little darker when roasting, and produce a lot more chaff than a fully washed coffee. Hacienda Sonora sits at 1300 meters above sea level, and is planted in a variety of cultivars, including this Caturra separation, which is a natural mutation of old Bourbon types initially discovered in Brazil, and known for high cup quality.

Sweet profiles of simmering berries, plum jam, apple, and even a tropical/floral hint of passionfruit juice. City to Full City. Good for espresso.	When this latest Ethiopian decaf was returned to us after being processed, we were pretty floored by the cup quality. Tasting it alongside the rest of our decaf arrivals (which are all very nice, btw!) the cup flavors tasted dramatically different; complex, fruited, aromatic, and undeniably Ethiopian! Context plays a large role in this perception, so I don't want to overpromise here. But as far as decafs go, the aromatic qualities make it stand out from the pack, and will likely fly under the radar as being decaf at all. The dry fragrance gives off dried fruit, like raisin and prune, with aromatic sugars and berries. The wet aroma had more intense fruited characteristics that skewed to the 'winey' side, accented by dark spice notes. Mirabawi Buna is a very sweet brewed coffee, and origin flavors become easier to pinpoint the longer you sip it. Light roasts are where I get the most fruited character, as well as a surprisingly moderate level of acidity. The flavor profiles profiles hinted at simmering berries, plum jam, apple, and even a tropical/floral hint of passionfruit juice. There are some faint wheaty/decaf notes in the finish, but they're hardly the focus. We've had great luck using previous versions of this decaf as espresso when roasted to Full City. It's also a very nice option to use as 1:1 Moka Java blend in conjunction with our current Indonesia "Nusantara" decaf from Swiss. Pre-roast blending works really well, but it can also be fun to roast them separately and try blending a melange of ratios and roast levels to fine tune the flavor profile.	We just got this delicious Ethiopian decaf back from being processed at Swiss Water in Vancouver, Canada, and are amazed by how it's tasting! It helps that it's made up from coffees that we loved before being decaffeinated, and consisted of 2/3 dry process, 1/3 wet process. Including fruited dry process coffees in the mix has been a key ingredient of most of our Ethiopian decaf recipes, and a big part of why they come back tasting so nice. It's no secret that all decaffeination processes are hard on the coffee, and tend to flatten out some of the more nuanced cup flavors. But with fruit-forward dry process coffees, the process merely softens some of those heavy-handed flavors. This is one of the reasons we love working with Swiss; it allows us to send high quality coffee from our own stocks, and affords us a level of control where we can customize blends to our own taste. This lot is mostly made up of coffees from Ethiopia's Western Jimma region. The bulk of it is split between two larger scale farms run by Dehab Mesfin, near the Bonga forest in Kafa, and Senna Katta Mountain farm, in Limu's Boter forest reserve. Swiss Water Decaf decaf use their patented chemical-free, water-decaffeination process to remove 99.9% of the coffee's caffeine content. The technique is gentle on the coffee's organic structure, leaving much of the aromatic compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. Read more about the Swiss Water technique here.

Notes of red berry, Meyer lemon, spiced black tea, bergamot orange, and sweet finish. City to Full City.	At City and City+ roasts, the stage is set for complex sweetness in the cup profile. The dry fragrance confirms this, with a deeply sweet caramelized sugar scent in the ground, and also sees notes of dried fruits, and fresh hops folded in. After pouring the hot water, accents of butterscotch and caramel come up in the steam, accented by notes of candied ginger, and lemon balm that bring a perfumed quality to the mix. In the brewed coffee, a mingling of flavorsome citrus and raw sugar notes pair very well, and bring grounding sweetness to the fairly high-toned coffee. Light roasts are fruited, and notes of dark berry, aromatic Meyer lemon, and black tea are revealed as it cools. The citrus flavors are grabby, buttressed by flavor aspects of dark brown sugar, and with a slight caramelizing/cooked sugar sweetness in the aftertaste. City to City+ roasts shimmer in terms of brightness, and cool to tart citrus accent notes, along with spiced black tea, and hint of bergamot orange on the nose. Our Full City roasts was no slouch either, and manage to squeeze plump sweetness from a syrupy chocolate flavor base, along with notes of dark berry, and black currant.	This coffee is from the Ichamama Factory, a washing station near Karima Hill in Nyeri. The station was named after the Ichamama river which flows near enough to the station to be the source of water for processing coffee. Ichamama is one of 19 washing stations that make up the Othaya Farmer's Coopertive Society, a coop-run organization, one of the older ones I might add. Othaya started in the mid-1950s, ballooning from 250 original members to 15,000 strong today. Karima is one of the older of the group, erected in 1964, and currently with nearly 1,000 farmer members (and is one of the most productive of the 19). The station sits at about 1750 meters above sea level, and coffee is grown in the higher altitude areas surrounding it. This lot "AB" is a separation of the medium-large sized beans measured in a range of 15/65" to 17/64". When compared with the two other upper tier grades "Peaberry" and "AA", it's not always indicative of higher or lower quality, though the cash premium spread generally favors the AA slightly more than AB or Peaberry. Check out our processing video taken during our 2024 travel that illustrates some of the unique ways in which Kenyan coffee is processed.

City to Full City+. Great decaf espresso!	When grinding the coffee, I picked up on a very nice interplay of sweet-savory notes, like buckwheat pancake with maple syrup, with a nice dark cocoa note. Pouring hot water on the coffee brought out a sweet molasses note, along with a slightly smokey note of caramelized sugar, and puffed rice cereal. The cup is remarkably sweet for decaf, with bright accents, and captures a lot of the flavor profiles and cup characteristics we find of non-decaf Central American coffees. City+ roasts have tasty bittering notes at the edges of caramel and raw sugars, with an apple top note that quickly fades to hints of tree nuts/pistachio and rye in the aftertaste. Full City roasts are more low toned but still very sweet, and offers hints of barley malt, with chocolatey finishing flavors, like Ghirardelli hot cocoa. This makes a standout decaf espresso, with a bittersweet base note that's perfect for a cappuccino, or to enjoy solo.	Our Cordillera Central decaf blend includes a rotating cast of coffees from countries straddling the vast mountain ranges of Central America. It's the decaf version of our popular Altiplano blend, that we keep in stock most of the year. Like Altiplano, this blend is put together with balance in mind, choosing coffees that are fresh, offer sweetness and moderate acidity, and are capable of dense chocolate roast flavors when roasted dark. We favor coffees that work well as brewed coffee and espresso, and that show well at a variety of roast levels, so that we get a decaf that hits those same marks. Swiss Water decaf in Vancouver BC are a key ingredient in that last part. Their patented chemical-free water process method is one of the gentler methods out there, and we've found that the coffees we have processed by Swiss come back tasting great. All decaffeination methods impact flavor to some extent, but the Swiss process seems to leaves some of the volatile compounds that affect flavor and aroma intact. Send off a fruity coffee, get a fruity decaf in return. Or in this case, a sweet decaf with balanced low tones and modest acidity!

Aromatic and floral, with flavor profiles that are clean and clearly articulated. Simple syrup, honey, fresh apple, jasmine, rue, Earl Grey, and tea-like acidity. City to City+.	The floral, bright, and well articulated cup flavors tasted in this wet processed lot from Chelbesa Danche are "Yirga Cheffe" all the way! The dry fragrance shows perfumed floral notes, tuberose and jasmine, fragrant raw sugars, hints of fruit candies, like green apple Jolly Ranchers. You get a sense of the classic Yirga Cheffe floral character in the wet aroma as well, more fragrant florals, backed by sugars with a toasted/caramelized edge, along with hints of cinnamon, and crystalized ginger. Cupping a City roast, Chelbesa Danche makes for an incredibly aromatic cup, with depth of sweetness that acts as a connecting point for some of the more elegant, outlier top notes. The flavors are delightful and clean, and cools to fresh flavor notes of apple, and fruit salad. The cup aroma is very complex, with fresh rue herbal accents that play off star jasmine floral aromatics. Our light roast boasted a modest level of acidity that brought to mind tea-like qualities. Roasting super light can sometimes lead to stunted sweetness, but that wasn't the case with ours. Chelbesa's cup sweetness really comes through in the cup, and lasts in the finish too. It starts off transparent, like simple syrup, but then branches out to a delicate honey note, with a fragrant aftertaste of sugar cane and Earl Grey tea. This is one to roast light. I developed one roast to Full City too, but recommend sticking to City-City+ for peak aromatics, though accidental dark roasts develop a juicy grape note amidst sharp roast bittersweetness.	Danche is the name of the small hamlet within Chelbesa town where this wet mill and coffee are from, in District Gedeb. This is one of the largest coffee producing areas in Gedeb, boasting semi-forested shade canopy in many parts, and altitudes ranging from 1900 to a staggering 2200 meters above sea level. The washing station Chelbesa is relatively new, having only been built back in 2019. It is part of a group of stations run by SNAP Specialty Coffee, Chelbesa being one of their most recent ventures. The wet mill is outfitted with ceramic tile fermentation tanks designed to retain heat. This area is very cold, and they even cover the coffee in plastic taurpolin while fermenting to help in this effort. From a practical standpoint, tile tanks are also a lot easier to clean than cement tanks (also commonly used) being a less porous material. The coffee is fermented without water for 72 to 96 hours before washing away the sticky mucilate, and transferring to the drying tables. They currently buy coffee from nearly 500 farmers in Chelbesa village who typically manage very small farms, often 200 coffee or less. This fully washed, wet process coffee from Chelbesa exudes the clean floral characteristics we often think of as synonymous with the Yirga Cheffe region, which makes sense given it's proximity to the region. I'll also note that the site is certified organic, though this lot was not purchased with certification. The cup sweetness is refined and delicious, and the cup aroma when roasted light is heady and complex. We tried roasts from a light City (approximately 10F past 1st Crack) to Full City (approx. 30F past 1st Crack), and feel that City to City+ is the appropriate range for highlighting the aromatic cup that's described in our review.

City to Full City.	What a pristine cup this lot from Gatugi makes, with refined sweetness that has the transparency of simple syrup, and bright fruit flavors that bring remarkable lift in light roasts. The dry fragrance of a City roast had smelled lively, with a fruit salad of berries and citrus, along with aromatic 5 spice, and fresh ginger. The wet aroma was intensely sweet, with notes of sugar cane juice, cranberry sauce, juicy orange, as well as an accent of loose-leaf black teas. Citrus flavors made their mark in the brewed coffee, and had juicy fruit aspects of different types of citrus, like tangerine, and pink grapefruit, which fed into brilliant acidity that shimmered bright. The profile unfolds to include accents of tropical passion fruit, and red berries that impart a ripe, juicy aspect, fresh in flavor. The aftertaste is clean and refined, with finishing flavors that hint at black tea, with clove oil aroma in the finish. With a bit more roast development, the fruit flavors are darker, still juicy and bright, with immense sweetness anchoring the cup, and a faint bittersweet roast accent in the finish. But don't take Gatugi too dark and risk covering up the clean and vibrant flavors that make it such a super star Kenyan coffee.	Gatugi is one of several coffees we picked up from Othaya Farmer's Cooperative Society (FCS), an FCS that includes an impressive amount of wet mills, 18 in all, dating back to the late 1950s. Gatugi Factory sits at just under 1900 meters above sea level, right along the Ichamama River, which is fed from the Karima forest above. "Factories" are essentially small washing stations aligned with a particular "society" in Kenya, what we would call a "cooperative". We return to the societies who seem to regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees, and each year we come across societies that are new to us as well. Being one of the older Kenya FCS, we are well aware of the quality coming out of Othaya. A lot of hand labor goes into the post-harvest processing. From farmers removing under ripe and over ripe coffee cherries on delivery, to coop workers sorting out defects at the drying beds, the impact all this work has on the cup can't be overstated (we have a great video illustrating this work, here). This is the AA outturn, which just means it's the largest bean separation from a particular coffee process batch. I often let my AA Kenyas run a few seconds longer in the roaster than a smaller bean in order to allow for proper internal roast development. Roasted too fast and light, and you might wind up with grassy/raw flavors from an underdeveloped center.

City to Full City.	A cleanly spiced sweetness comes up from the ground coffee, with spikes of citrus tea, and grape-toned fruit. The wet aromatics are heavily-laden with dark sugar smells, complex spice notes like clove syrup, and candied ginger, and dried floral accent. We roasted to both City and Full City roast levels for this review, making for quite different cup experiences. Orange citrus brightness is present from light to dark, but most brilliant on the light end of that spectrum (no surprise). This isn't a fruit-bomb cup, rather it revolves around ample raw sugar complexity, and a variety of citrus, and dried fruit accent notes. A steady undercurrent of brown sugar and cinnamon hints provide a solid platform for citrus highlights to shine, offering up profiles of holiday spice cookie, and dried citrus notes. As the cup cools down a bit, delicate flavors start to emerge, like pomegranate tea, cardamom, dried stone fruit, and orange. Full City roasts show a departure from bold high tones, though still present, and are more like citrus zest rather than fresh juice. Smokey cocoa fills out the middle and finish and is accompanied by notes of dark grape juice, clove, and juicy body.	This coffee is from the Gatuyaini Factory, a washing station more or less. Nothing industrious about it, except for the machinery to wash and depulp coffee cherries! Gatuyaini is one of 19 washing stations that make up the Othaya Farmer's Coopertive Society, a coop-run organization, one of the older ones I might add. Othaya started in the mid-1950s, ballooning from 250 original members to 15,000 strong today. Altitude of the washing station is just shy of 1900 meters, and you mostly see SL-28 and SL-34, along with a little Ruiru mixed in. We keep returning to the societies who regularly produce some of the best Kenya coffees we see, and each year we come across coffees new to us - like Gatuyaini - and this list continues to grow. This is an "AB" separation, which denotes the size of the beans. All coffee in Kenya is sorted by size using large industrial screening machines. There's a grading name attached to each size range, "AA" for the largest beans, and in this case, "AB", which means that the beans fall between 15/64" and 17/64". Honestly, this doesn't always equate to a quality difference in the cup, but it does affect the price. AA's typically command the highest prices. And while we bought plenty of AA coffee this year, this AB lot from Gatuyaini won us over! See our video on Kenya post-harvest processing, here.
50	Kenya Nyeri Mahiga Peaberry	91	0	\N	2025-01-17	September 2024 Arrival	Othaya, Nyeri	Wet Process (Washed)	Raised Bed Sun-Dried	30	60 KG	GrainPro Liner	1	SL-28, SL-34, Ruiru-11	Peaberry	.2 d/300gr, 15 Peaberry Screen	City to Full City	Farm Gate	https://www.sweetmarias.com/kenya-nyeri-mahiga-peaberry-8095.html	2	16.60	1.50	2025-01-20 09:24:14	Mahiga makes a refined Kenya cup, with raw sugars and punchy fruit notes, peach and tart apricot, pineapple upside down cake, brown sugar, cardamom, and a bright splash of acidity. City to Full City.	This peaberry lot from Mahiga brews up a refined cup profile, with clean sugary sweetness and fruit notes that punchy, and aromatic. The dry fragrance had a sweet smell of red fruit and berry tea, with notes of raw sugar, and a grapefruit peel accent added a fragrant aspect to the sweetness. The wet aromatics were nicely fruited as well, both my City and City+ roasts displayed compote-like fruits, pie filling, and stone fruits. The cup was bright, especially when roasted to City/City+, where a splash of berry-like acidity (tartaric) added a nice charge to the flavor profile. My City roast had a sweet-tart hint of apricot, and a juicy fruit punch note. There's a brown sugar flavor that brings out some cooked fruit notes too, like pineapple or peach upside down cake. Full City roasts offer surprisingly robust bittersweetness, a flavor of fine Dutch drinking cocoa, and the plump dark fruits are still very much a part of the profile too. I really enjoyed this coffee from a light City roast on up to Full City, but would not venture into 2nd crack.	The Mahiga Factory washing station sits at 1800 meters in the Othaya constituency of Nyeri County. With just over 500 farmer members, Mahiga collects and processes the whole coffee cherry for farmer members using a disc depulping machine before fermenting the coffee in order to remove the sticky demucilage layer. After the fruit is removed, the coffee is then soaked in clean water where they are completely "washed" of any remaining fruit residue, and then dried on raised coffee drying beds. Farmers in the region grow mainly SL-28 and SL-34, with small amounts of Ruiru mixed in. Mahiga is one of several coffees we picked up from Othaya Farmers Cooperative Society (FCS), an FCS that includes an impressive amount of wet mills, 18 in all, and their work in the region dates back to the late 1950s. Coffee is processed and kept separate by process batch at the factory in order to identify quality. (See our video on Kenya processing, here). The separated batches are then run through screens in order to separate beans by size, the most common being AA (17-19 screen), AB (15-17 screen), and Peaberry, all of which are referred to as "out-turns". This is the Peaberry outturn, a natural mutation that occurs where only 1 of 2 coffee seeds inside the coffee cherry germinates, causing it to take on a small, round shape like the cherry itself. We found it to have more of a delicate fruited side than the other lots we tasted from this station.

City to Full City+. Good for espresso.	The dry fragrance is laced with cane sugar sweetness and spiced hints, with fruit accents that are slight, and a tea-like sparkle. There's a real depth of sweetness that blossoms in the wet aroma, a complex mix of brown sugars, and fragrant raw honey, along with a hint of berry, and a slightly floral aspect. The brewed coffee is substantially sweet, without losing the aromatic characteristics smelled up front. The sweetness is marked by notes of cane sugar aspects, with a lively mix of citrus and berry notes, like pomegranate, and the zing of raspberry lemonade. The finish at City and City+ displays delicate suggestions of loose leaf black tea, and like aromatic English Breakfast. Tumba shows a very nice level of acidity when roasted light, with aspects of black tea and a spritz of orange that bring out a brisk, mouth cleansing finish. Tumba's sweetness holds up to darker roast levels, and my Full City roast showed a layer of dark fruit, like plum, beneath the cocoa roast flavors. Dark roasts of Tumba have always been a favorite single origin espresso around here: bittersweet, chocolate-laden, heavy body, with an aroma of fruit and spice...so nice!	The coffee from Tumba washing station was on my radar for years before we first bought it almost a decade ago. When I first tasted it, the sweetness and bright acidic snap in the cup made a great impression. But at the time I noticed varied quality from one cup to the next, and a lack of consistency can mean problems in the processing. For a coffee buyer, it signifies that what you taste now might not be what you get upon importation. The backstory at the time was Tumba Station was a private processing wet mill that had 2 owners with very different ideas of quality and how to run a mill. Fast forward a few years, and we found ourselves purchasing Tumba for the first time under a very different light. A local teacher in the Tumba area for which the mill is named, had taken over all aspects, and the coffee was consistent in every cup ... and amazingly good! Venustre Mugraneza, the teacher, is esteemed in the local community and has been systematically improving the mill. The best coffee cherries (those that make up this lot) are dried in a special area of raised beds and receive focused handpicking by the farmers. Tumba is situated at 1825 meters in the Rulindo district, where we've also sourced the excellent Cocatu Cooperative lots.

Notes of blueberry and blackberry have juicy brightness, accented by flavors of melon, cascara tea, hints of rose water and fresh herbs. City to Full City.	Light roasts of Guji Tuku brewed a very impressive cup, with an interplay of complex fruits and delicate aromatics. The ground coffee had a sweet smell of dark honey, pancake syrup, dehydrated berries, melon, and frankincense. The wet aroma smelled just as incredible. My light City roast (1:30 post 1st Crack) had a scent of floral blueberry, whole clove, honey, and Chai tea. The cup flavors are bright and delicious, and flavor profiles at the City level are as intensely fruited as they are delicate and aromatic. Layers of fruit unfold to reveal notes of juicy blueberry and blackberry, ripe green melon, and coffee fruit ("cascara") tea. The cup offers impressive acidity when roasted light that gives the fruity cup profile a sturdy structure. For dry process coffee, it has a lot of the floral and fragrant flavors that you expect from washed Ethiopian coffee, like hints of jasmine, and rose water. City+ roasts had a complex note of pomegranate syrup, along with fresh herbal notes of rue, and coriander. I did not roast this coffee darker, but would not hesitate to go as dark as Full City if you're looking for a fruited dark roast.	The lot was processed at a privately owned coffee mill called "Tuku", not far from Gerba town, Guji Zone. It's named after the owner (green jacket, third photo), who is working with a local exporter as a vertically integrated entity. In this case, the exporter affords Tuku financing to buy cherries during the harvest season, and a link to the market. The processing site sits at 2125 meters above sea level, and some of the farms they buy from are even higher elevation. The dry process method is the oldest way of processing whole coffee cherries down to the green seeds we roast, and is a big part of why coffees like Tuku taste so fruity. It takes a lot longer to dry whole coffee cherries down to the standard of 10-11% moisture, and during that time a fermentation occurs within. Not only are dry process coffees often fruit-forward, they also produce a lot more chaff than fully washed ("wet process"). Just be aware of it and be sure to vacuum your roaster between batches, especially for those with open heating elements, like a Behmor. Speaking of which, we're seeing some pretty small beans in this lot, thankfully not so small that you need to worry about roasting in your Behmor. We tested 200 grams of coffee, and only had a couple beans slip through the grid.

6	ROAST 6	2	ETHIOPIA 1	2024-02-21	10.00	\N	EXT TUBE - Roast 5 had a little earlier first crack than I wanted. Try to hold the maillard stage longer so that I hit first crack at 6-6:30. Go for a light - medium roast. Hopefully this will improve consistency by holding the first two stages longer. Shoot for 15-20% in development\nNever brought power over 1\nFelt like the fan was too high basically the whole time\nRan it for a minute into rolling first crack\nNeed to figure out how to make the first 2 stages longer.

9	COMPANY ROAST 1	4	HONDURAS 1	2024-02-24	9.00	8.00	got up to p6 and then ramped down to p4 right as first crack hit. First crack was right next to rolling crack. Very consistent!	F9 P1 - once moving move up to P3, P+ EVERY MINUTE	2025-01-06
10	COMPANY ROAST 2	5	BRAZIL 1	2024-02-25	9.00	8.00	trying to push to maillard a litte faster and hold maillard longer. p6 at maillard. pulled down to p4 at 5:10 right before crack. crack wasnt consistent. Weird intermittent crack that started quite early & not very loud. really poor consistency of bean again, though better than roast 1 and 2.. the brazil is giving me issues	F9 P2 - once moving move up to P4, P+ EVERY MINUTE	2025-01-06
11	SAM'S ROAST	3	GUATEMALA 1	2024-02-26	9.00	8.00	my temps are way boyond what most people say. Need to keep cooling in machine, the collander does not cool effectively. pulled 30 sec after hearing a solid rolling crack. Loss indicates light medium roast. basically only changed fan speed when the beans we jumping too high. only moved power when I felt like the beans were close and I wanted fc to have a tighter rolling crack, took it up to p3.	drying target - 350F\nmaillard target - 410\n430 at fc\ndown to 410 after, drop immediately after end of rolling crack	2025-01-06

15	WILL'S BLEND	5	BRAZIL 1	2024-03-02	9.00	8.00	wanted to see if I could get this poppin about the same time frame as the guat so I could roast them together with the 5oz guat.\n\nheld a bit longer to get the roast more even. Got a more dark even look going that looked more medium and cut it 1 min into rolling crack. cracks were more subtle and harder to hear. 	350F DRYING, 480F END OF MAILLARD, DROP HEAT AT 6:00	2025-01-06

41	final hond-sad boi roast	4	HONDURAS 1	2024-03-28	9.00	\N	I think ripping it as early as I have been in this session, the beans really do not roast as even. I could dial it back a little and get a more even roast with less beans entering 2C and a more unified FC. the key here is balence. 	rip early, 30 sec dev. make sure full rolling	2025-01-06

46	new phone who dis med	10	Ethiopia Organic Gera Genji Challa	2024-04-27	8.00	7.00	did much better than roast 2. the cold start appears to be much different than the warm start for this bean. Need to feather up the temp sooner to delay the crack I think.	rip early pull 60 sec after fc	2025-01-06
47	new phone who dis med med	10	Ethiopia Organic Gera Genji Challa	2024-04-27	8.00	7.00	still was rolling into end but I felt that 1:30 was pretty good. It was getting pretty dark. 	rip early pull at fc end.. 90 sec?	2025-01-06
48	etho bombe 1 light	6	Ethiopia Dry Process Sidama Bombe	2024-04-28	8.00	7.00	the bean size is definitely a bit of a challenge here. I tried to bring the fan back up to offset this half way through maillard. 	rip early & slow down last leg of the roast to lengthen the maillard slightly and allow the beans to catch up to the small screen size beans	2025-01-06
