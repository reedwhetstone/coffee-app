Here are standout Ethiopian lots with clear stone-fruit character and a unique processing twist:

- **Ethiopia Yirgacheffe G1 ‚ÄúSupernatural‚Äù ‚Äì Banko Chelchele (Anaerobic Natural) [ID 1054]**

  - Unique processing: 7‚Äì10 days sealed, low-temp anaerobic fermentation, then raised-bed drying.
  - Flavor: Strawberry jam, **apricot** and melon; clean lemony brightness; creamy cocoa structure.
  - Roast tips: Aim for medium‚Äëlight (just after 1C) to keep the tropical/apricot notes vivid and avoid boozy edges; keep post‚Äëcrack tight.
  - Brew: Pour-over or flat-bottom drippers highlight clarity; also fun as a bright, fruit-forward espresso.

- **Ethiopia Dry Process Hambela Buliye (Slow‚ÄëDried Natural) [ID 1092]**
  - Unique processing: High-elevation site that produces naturals only; longer bed drying (‚âà3‚Äì4 weeks) at 2150‚Äì2200 MASL for distinctive development.
  - Flavor: Dried **apricot**, plum, mango, blueberry; dark sugar/caramelized sweetness with a bit of structure.
  - Roast tips: City to City+ for stone fruit pop and syrupy sweetness; slightly longer Maillard for clarity; rest 3‚Äì5 days.
  - Brew: Versatile across filter; excellent as a fruity espresso if you enjoy bold berry/dark cocoa finish.

If you‚Äôd like a decaf option with stone fruit:

- **Ethiopia Sidama Worku Buche Washed Decaf (Mountain Water) [ID 434]** ‚Äì plum, vanilla, cinnamon; very clean for decaf, City‚ÄìCity+.
